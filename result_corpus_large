In every corner of my memory
  There's no place you wouldn't be
  lf anything, I wish I had
  Another dream with you
  Life was forever yesterday
  Nothing in the world could take
  Your love away...
  will I ever know
  That time will ease the pain for me someday

She said I won't leave you ever
  Just love me forever
  She said you can leave but never
  Walk away

Light's reflecting in the evening sun
  Back to the place where we were one
  Soul mates forever about to chase
  Rainbows in the dark
  Another day to destiny
  Come on and set me free
  When I close my eyes, I see your smile
  As I walk in the pouring rain
  I call your name

She said I won't leave you ever
  Just love me forever
  She said, we will be together someday
  She said I won't leave you ever
  Just love me forever
  She said, you can leave,
  But never walk away

I can see a million faces
  When I take a walk outside
  But I just never knew
  That I could go a million places
  And I'd see always only you

The loneliness crawls up on me
  Without you there's no me
  At any time or any place
  But time will ease the pain for me someday

She said I won't leave you ever
  Just love me forever
  She said, we will be together someday
  She said, I will wait forever
  I won't leave you ever
  She said, you can leave,
  But never ever walk away

Don't walk away
  Oh no don't walk away
  I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting always
  Until you wake up from this dream
  Someday



She Said (перевод Юрий Бардин)

In every corner of my memory
  There's no place you wouldn't be
  lf anything, I wish I had
  Another dream with you
  Life was forever yesterday
  Nothing in the world could take
  Your love away...

  That time will ease the pain for me someday

She said I won't leave you ever
  Just love me forever
  She said you can leave but never

Down, I am down
On the ground, sad and tired
I'm down, it's over now
Yes I'm down, should I like it

It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
It's deep and dark
Since we've been apart

Is this love that comes around
That takes me up light years higher
'cause I wanna feel love once again

It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
It's deep and dark
Since we've been apart

It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
It's deep and dark
Without someone's love


Across the desert plains 
  Where nothing dares to grow
  I taught you how to sing
  You taught me everything I know
  And thought the night is young
  And we don't know if we'll live to see the sun

The best is yet to come
  I know, you know
  That we've only just begun
  Through the highs and lows
  And how can I live without you
  You're such a part of me
  And you've always been the one
  Keeping me forever young
  And the best is yet to come

Don't look now, the best is yet to come
  Take my hand, the best is yet to come

Thinking of the times
  How we laughed and cried
  I wouldn't change a thing
  I couldn't even if I tried
  Through the wind and rain
  The spirit of our song remains the same

And the best is yet to come
  I know, you know
  That we've only just begun
  Through the highs and lows
  And how can I live without you
  You're such a part of me
  And you've always been the one
  Keeping me forever young
  And the best is yet to come

Don't look now, the best is yet to come
  Take my hand, the best is yet to come

Oh can you feel it in the air
  It's in your heart and everywhere
  We got to keep that dream alive

We cross another road
  And face another day
  Soldiers never die
  They only fade away
  How can we grow old
  When the soundtrack of our lives is rock and roll

And the best is yet to come
  I know, you know
  That we've only just begun
  Through the highs and lows
  And how can I live without you
  You're such a part of me
  And you've always been the one
  Keeping me forever young
  And the best is yet to come

Don't look now, the best is yet to come
  Take my hand, the best is yet to come



The Best Is Yet to Come

Across the desert plains
  Where nothing dares to grow
  I taught you how to sing
  You taught me everything I know
  And thought the night is young
  And we don't know if we'll live to see the sun

The best is yet to come
  I know, you know
  That we've only just begun
  Through the highs and lows
  And how can I live without you
  You're such a part of me
  And you've always been the one
  Keeping me forever young
  And the best is yet to come

Don't look now, the best is yet to come
  Take my hand, the best is yet to come

Thinking of the times
  How we laughed and cried
  I wouldn't change a thing
  I couldn't even if I tried
  Through the wind and rain
  The spirit of our song remains the same

And the best is yet to come
  I know, you know
  That we've only just begun
  Through the highs and lows
  And how can I live without you
  You're such a part of me
  And you've always been the one
  Keeping me forever young
  And the best is yet to come

Don't look now, the best is yet to come
  Take my hand, the best is yet to come

Oh can you feel it in the air
  It's in your heart and everywhere
  We got to keep that dream alive

We cross another road
  And face another day
  Soldiers never die

  How can we grow old
  When the soundtrack of our lives is rock and roll

And the best is yet to come

  Through the highs and lows
  And how can I live without you
  You're such a part of me
  And you've always been the one
  Keeping me forever young
  And the best is yet to come

Don't look now, the best is yet to come
  Take my hand, the best is yet to come [3х]





Maybe I, maybe you

I'm a man
  Trying to understand
  The reason I'm lost in this world
  Tonight
  I was blind
  I just couldn't see the signs
  Caught in your web of lies

It's too dark to sleep
  Too late to pray
  Too hard to reach
  Too much to save

You were once a friend to me
  Now you are my enemy
  Passion turns to hate and you make
  Hate worth fighting for
  I will re-write history
  And you will not exist to me
  On the day you crossed the line
  I found out love is war

Life goes by
  Faster than lightning strikes
  Crashes before you can say
  Goodbye

Too scared to run
  Too proud to hide
  Too far to fall
  Too high to climb

You were once a friend to me
  Now you are my enemy
  Passion turns to hate and you make
  Hate worth fighting for
  I will re-write history
  And you will not exist to me
  On the day you crossed the line
  I found out love is war

I laid down my defenses
  I opened up the door
  I gave you what you wanted
  I couldn't give you more
  And I gave you everything
  You said it's all or nothing
  To you it's just a game
  A game you're never losing 



Love Is War

I'm a man
  Trying to understand
  The reason I'm lost in this world
  Tonight
  I was blind
  I just couldn't see the signs
  Caught in your web of lies

It's too dark to sleep
  Too late to pray
  Too hard to reach

  Now you are my enemy
  Passion turns to hate and you make

  A game you're never losing 


Holding on to you like broken glass
Every touch cuts deeper than the last
I know I should leave
But it feels so good to bleed

Poison kisses lock us in this cage
Our lives got twisted in this masquerade
I can't seem to shake this incurable need
This endless addiction I feed

Angels on fire
They fall from the sky
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight
Covered in ashes I cry out your name
And out of the flames
We will rise again

Run in to the shadows where we hide
Bodies tender as our worlds collide
Nothing is sacred and everything's wrong
But you and I keep holding on

Angels on fire
They fall from the sky
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight
Covered in ashes I cry out your name
And out of the flames
We will rise again

No temptation is my sin
Not my darkest deepest whim

Angels on fire
They fall from the sky
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight
Covered in ashes I cry out your name
And out of the flames
We will rise
Angels on fire
They fall from the sky
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight
Covered in ashes I cry out your name
And out of the flames
We will rise again
We will rise again
We will rise




We Will Rise Again

Holding on to you like broken glass

Covered in ashes I cry out your name 
And out of the flames 
We will rise again 
We will rise again 
We will rise


Another rainy morning
People rushing by
My head is still in the clouds
I dream with open eyes
Suddenly out of nowhere
She came into my life
Like we know each other
For quite a while

In the sound of silence
Time is standing still
There's some kind of bond between us
That's givin' me the chill
Do you really wonder
That we can burn the sky
It's written a thousand years ago
In the book of life

Are you the one that God had made for me?
Are you the one who's always in my dreams?
The one who keeps me goin'
When I can't go on
The one that I've been waiting for
For so long

Suddenly out of nowhere
She came into my life

Are you the one that God had made for me?
Are you the one who's always in my dreams?

Are you the one that God had made for me?
Are you the one who's mine eternally?
The one who keeps me dreamin'
When I'm sad and tired
Who gives my life a meaning
Till the day I die

Are you the one?
Are you the one?



Are You the One
Another rainy morning
People rushing by
My head is still in the clouds
I dream with open eyes
Suddenly out of nowhere
She came into my life
Like we know each other
For quite a while

In the sound of silence
Time is standing still
There's some kind of bond between us
That's givin' me the chill
Do you really wonder
That we can burn the sky
It's written a thousand years ago

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one who's always in my dreams
The one who keeps me goin'
When I can't go on
The one that I've been waiting for

Are you the one that God had made for me

When I'm sad and tired
Who gives my life a meaning
Till the day I die

Are you the one
Are you the one


Here I go again
Feels like once upon a time
But this is here and now
You can try to read my mind 
Well, life has given me so much 
And so much more
True love is hard to find
When you're on the run

While all those years go by
The clock is ticking way too fast
And I just ask myself
What is going to be last
I've seen it all, but still
I've seen nothing yet at all
So I'm still looking for
Some diamonds and pearls

Bye-bye, girl
There's a road I gotta find
Called the gypsy life
I miss that life
Like a good old friend

Well, friends they come and go 
Some are here and some are gone 
And when the sun goes down
I will walk this road alone 
But now I´m here with you
And my heart is full of hope 
That life will bring me back 
Into your open arms

Bye-bye, girl
There's a road I gotta find
Called the gypsy life
I miss that life
Like a good old friend

Bye-bye, girl
There's a dream that's still alive
It will take some time 
A long, long time 
Until I'm back again
Love is the glue that hold us together
Faith and believing is the key, this door of forever
And baby you and I, we're every reason on Earth
To now and again, it's always us against the world, 
Against the world

When the rain fell
And the flood came
And the wind blew hard like a hammer on these walls
We didn't crack or break or fall
We built this house on a rock (oh ooh ooh)
This house on a rock (oh ooh ooh)

And there is the time to face stormy weather
But we are always standing strong, a lifetime together
Baby you and I, we don't regret anything
And now it's the two of us again against the wind, 
Against the wind

When the rain fell
And the flood came
And the wind blew hot like a hammer on these walls
We didn't crack or break or fall
We built this house on a rock (oh ooh ooh)
This house on a rock (oh ooh ooh)

Brick by brick, we have set it up
Oh men, if these walls could talk
Bit by bit, based it on trust
We gave it all we got

When the rain fell
And the flood came
And the wind blew hot like a hammer on these walls
We didn't crack or break or fall
We built this house on a rock (oh ooh ooh)
This house on a rock (oh ooh ooh)



Life's a kind of struggle
  Living in this town
  I'm never looking back just no just ahead
  My mind was locked up in a cage
  Always ready to break out
  These heavy chains on me drive me mad

[Chorus:]
  I wanna be in love tonight
  I wanna get you where I got you
  Give it just one night
  I wanna be your love tonight
  Slave me

Power's all that matters
  Only one of us can survive
  Tell me are you strong enough to stay on track
  Will I die and go to heaven
  If life was living hell
  All I know is I'm always coming back

[Chorus]

Get me wreck me
  Chase me check me
  Sex me down my spine
  Take me break me
  Love me hate me
  Make me lose my mind

[Chorus:]
  I wanna be in love tonight
  I wanna get you where I got you
  Give it just one night
  I wanna be your love tonight
  Slave me


I follow the Moskva 
  Down to Gorky Park listening to the wind of change 
  An August summer night, 
  Soldiers passing by listening to the wind of change.

The world is closing in, 
  Did you ever think that we could be so close, like brothers?
  The future's in the air 
  I can feel it everywhere blowing with the wind of change.

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night,
  Where the children of tomorrow dream away in the wind of change.

Walking down the street. 
  Distant memories are buried in the past forever.

The wind of change
  Blows straight into the face of time,

  Freedom bell for peace of mind.
  Let your Balalaika sing
  What my guitar wants to say

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night,
  Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams with you and me.

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night,

Listening to the wind of change
  An August summer night,
  Soldiers passing by 
Listening to the wind of change.

The world is closing in,
  Did you ever think 
That we could be so close, like brothers?
  The future's in the air
  I can feel it everywhere blowing with the wind of change.

Take me to the magic of the moment 
On a glory night,
  Where the children of tomorrow 
Dream away in the wind of change.

Walking down the street.
  Distant memories are buried in the past forever.
  I follow the Moskva
  Down to Gorky Park listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment 
On a glory night,
  Where the children of tomorrow 
Share their dreams with you and me.

Take me to the magic of the moment 
  On a glory night,
  Where the children of tomorrow dream away 
  In the wind of change.

The wind of change
  Blows straight into the face of time,
  Like a stormwind that will ring the
  Freedom bell for peace of mind.
  Let your Balalaika sing
  What my guitar wants to say

Take me to the magic of the moment 
  On a glory night,
  Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
  With you and me.

Take me to the magic of the moment 
  On a glory night,
  Where the children of tomorrow dream away 
  In the wind of change.



Ooh, dark meditation
Your second sight can show my light
In a crystal ball

Sweet are the days, intoxication
Crow-black, the nights caging my mind
Behind the wall

Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Into the rock to find the cream
Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Pictured life from yesterday

Ooh, dark meditation
Deep down inside a stream of light
Begins to flow

Sweet are the days, intoxication
Crow-black, the nights caging my mind
Behind the wall

Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Into the rock to find the cream
Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Pictured life from yesterday

Pictured life, pictured life
Pictured life from yesterday
Is this world out of control?
  Say, what is right, what is wrong?
  Do I know this world at all?
  I think, I do, but then I don't.
  I'm confused by what I see,
  I try to understand,
  But it makes no sense at all.

I'm confused by what I feel,
  I thought, that our love
  Was something, that is real.
  Does anyone know
  The truth, we're looking for,
  Can't find it anymore.
  Does anyone know,
  How to make me feel
  For something that is real?

So many things, that I recall,
  When we were young, just flying high.
  Can we turn our fate at all?
  I wish, we could, say "Don't you cry"
  I'm confused by what I hear,
  Girl, it seems to me,
  We're losing after all.

I'm confused by what I feel,
  I thought, that our love
  Was something, that is real.
  Does anyone know
  The truth we're looking for,
  Can't find it anymore.
  Does anyone know,
  How to make me feel
  For something, that is real?

Another day has just begun,
  Life goes on, there's no return.
  How can I trust anyone,
  When honesty is such a dirty word?

Does anyone know
  The truth we're looking for,
  Can't find it anymore.
  Does anyone know,
  How to make me feel
  For something, that is real?
  Does anyone know
  The truth we're looking for,
  Can't find it anymore.
  Does anyone know,
  How to make me feel
  For something, that is real?

Those mighty wheels keep rollin' on
  On to that crazy place
  That still feels like home
  The world outside is rushing by
  It feels good to take that road
  Time after time

I don't know how you feel
  My heart is beating fast
  It has been way too long
  But here I am, I'm back

It's good to know you're still around
  You'd never let me down, in my city
  You get my feet back on the ground
  You'd never let me down, in my city

No regrets, well just a few
  You haven't lost a thing
  I'm still crazy for you

I don't know how you feel
  Are you excited too
  It has been way too long
  Tonight I'm back with you

It's good to know you're still around
  You'd never let me down, in my city
  You get my feet back on the ground
  You'd never let me down, in my city

I've been no stranger
  To every corner of your heart
  Your dream still lives inside of me

I don't know how you feel
  My heart is beating fast
  It has been way too long
  But here I am, I'm back

In my city, my town
  Deep in my heart, I'm so proud
  Of my city, my town
  I'll never, ever let you down

It's good to know you're still around
  You'd never let me down, in my city
  You get my feet back on the ground
  You'd never let me down, in my city

My city, my town


When love kills love 

Suddenly I think I always knew 
  I had my share of mistakes 
  Made quite a few 
  Finally I know and that's for sure 
  I don't look back in anger anymore 

Suddenly the sun comes up again 
  There's a new beginning 
  When we pass the end 
  Finally I know and that's for sure 
  I don't look back in anger anymore 

When love kills love 
  Will someone rescue me 
  When love kills love 
  It's cutting through so deep 

Suddenly I wake up from the dream 
  Someone tells me 
  I've been talking in the sleep 
  Finally I know and that's for sure 
  I don't believe in daydreams anymore 

When love kills love 
  Will someone rescue me 
  When love kills love 
  It's cutting through so deep 

Well life goes 'round 
  And upside down 
  It's pretty mad 

When love kills love 
  Will someone set me free 
  When love kills love 
  It's cutting through so deep 

How can we choose 
  When all we lose Is all we have 

We run away from all the pain 
  We run away from all the pain 

When love kills love 
  Will someone rescue me 
  When love kills love 
  It's cutting through so deep 

When love kills love



You look at a poster
You look at the wall
The wall in the room where you live
Where you live with your stars
Just listen to his records
Now hear what he says
For he says, "I love you little girl
Come to see me today"

Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart
Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart

You like Alice Cooper
You like Ringo Starr
You like David Bowie
And friends in the Royal Albert Hall
Stick up the pictures, movies, TV
And I'll bring you the show little girl
Come to see me today [2x]

Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart
Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart



In the dirty old city
There is my home
There is my home
There is my home
There is my home
Nothing really looks pretty
And I've been alone
I've been alone
I've been alone
I've been alone

And in my heart many wishes are crying
Living and Dying
And in my heart many wishes are crying
Living and Dying

In the house of darkness
There's a magic stone
magic stone
magic stone
the magic stone
But I couldn't find it
'Cause the shine is gone
shine is gone
shine is gone
the shine is gone

And in my heart many wishes are crying
Living and Dying
And in my heart many wishes are crying
Living and Dying
Living and Dying
Living and Dying


The lights are slowly fading down
There's no one else, just you and me
Nothing ever changed
I see your faces in the crowd
It seems I know each one of you
For all my life
I wish this night could last forever
But it's time to go
I saw you laugh, I saw you cry
All for one and one for all
Nothing ever changed
The way you sang just blew my mind
It gave me chills from head to toe
What a glorious night
To me it could have lasted forever
But it's time to go

A moment in a million years
Is all I've got for you
A moment in a million years
To make some dreams come true
A moment that I won't forget
Until the day I die
A moment in a million years
Called life

The bus is waiting right outside
To hit the road and once again
I leave you all behind
I chase another dream tonight
And by the time you'll be home
I'll be far away
I wish this night could last forever
But it's time to go

A moment in a million years
Is all I've got for you
A moment in a million years
To make some dreams come true
A moment that I won't forget
Until the day I die
A moment in a million years
Called life

A moment that I can't forget
Until the day I die
A moment in a million years
Called life

Working hard to get it on for you
  Everyday and night
  I give you all I've got to give
  Take it all
  Love I know that you're feelin' blue
  Lonely deep inside
  Cause I know how it feels to be alone

Loving you Sunday morning
  You were on my mind love everyday
  Loving you Sunday morning
  Your love makes me fly so far away

People tell me that I'm gonna lose you
  Our love will die
  So tell me is it true right or wrong
  I never ever wanna lose your love
  So I will change my life
  Believe in me my love
  I'm coming home

Loving you Sunday morning
  You were on my mind love everyday
  Loving you Sunday morning
  Your love makes me fly so far away

Working hard to get it on for you
  Everyday and night
  I give you all I've got to give
  Take it all
  Love I know that you're feelin' blue
  Lonely deep inside
  Cause I know how it feels to be alone

Loving you Sunday morning
  You were on my mind love everyday
  Loving you Sunday morning
  Your love makes me fly so far away




It's early morning
The sun comes out
Last night was shaking
And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin
So what is wrong
With another sin
The bitch is hungry
She needs to tell
So give her inches
And feed her well
More days to come
New places to go
I've got to leave
It's time for a show

Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning
It starts to shout
Desire is coming
It breaks out loud
Lust is in cages
Till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it
With someone I choose
The night is calling
I have to go
The wolf is hungry
He runs the show
He's licking his lips
He's ready to win
On the hunt tonight
For love at first sting

Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make men more wise?

Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just heard my brain
But will it seem the same?

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been?

Fall into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Shapes of things
Shapes of things
Shapes of things
Shapes of things



* – Кавер на композицию Shapes Of Things в оригинальном исполнении The Yardbirds
Cry like you feel
Try like you feel, feel it
Try to escape
Cry to escape, escape it

It's so hard to run away
He's a virgin killer

No, no, no, can't you see?
No, no, no, can't you see?
You're a demon's, you're a demon's
You're a demon's desire

Death on the screen
Sadistic magazines, watch out
Suicides everyday
Political ways, get it

Well, you can't find new ways
But he's a virgin killer

No, no, no, can't you see?
No, no, no, can't you see?
You're a demon's, you're a demon's
You're a demon's desire

Garbage in the streams
A-bombs in your dreams, look out
Sharks in the pictures
Exorcist prescriptions, forget it

Try to get away from that
'Cos he's a virgin killer

No, no, no, can't you see?
No, no, no, can't you see?
You're a demon's, you're a demon's
You're a demon's desire
Don't hear the phone, that rings.
  I know the fever's coming.
  God knows, what life will bring
  This Sunday morning, Sunday morning, without a warning.
  Don't hear the neighbour scream,
  He thinks, my house is burning.
  Life is good to me
  This Sunday morning, yeah!
  She's a wild child,
  And her l-l-love turns a man insane.
  She's a wild child,
  And the love, she makes, rocks the mind off my brain.

Don't hear the backdoor crack,
  Don't see the cops are coming back.
  It's burnin' in my bed
  This Sunday morning, yeah!
  She's a wild child, she's a wild child,
  And her l-l-love turns a man insane.
  She's a wild child, she's a wild child,
  And the love, she makes, rocks the mind off my brain.

She's on fire!
  She's on fire!
  She's on fire!

She's a wild child,
  And her l-l-love turns a man insane.
  She's a wild child,
  And the love, she makes, rocks the mind off my brain.
  She's a wild child, she's a wild child,
  And her l-l-love turns a man insane.
  She's a wild child, she's a wild child,
  And the love, she makes, rocks the mind off my brain.
  She's a wild child.
  She's a wild child.
  Yeah!
  She's a wild child, she's a wild child,
  And her l-l-love turns a man insane.
  She's a wild child, she's a wild child,
  And the love, she makes, rocks the mind off my brain.


Can you feel it, love is waiting there
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there

Something has come over me
I can't explain how full and free
I want you to feel it
Suddenly deep inside I have peace on my mind
I want you to feel it

On the last day that I walked the earth
I found the answer to the question that we all search
Where do we go from here

Can you feel it, love is waiting there
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there

Come inside, now you are cold
No colours block unopen doors
I want you to feel it
Suddenly deep inside, you have peace on your mind
Tell me, can you feel it

It's the last chance to take a look inside
It's up to you to change the world for a better life
Where do we go from here

Can you feel it, love is waiting there
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there
Can you feel it, love is waiting there
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there



The easy way
  Is not the way my life will take
  Because the limit is the sky
  The easy way
  Is not the way that I can take
  My life's in pieces half the time

Dancing on a razor blade
  Break the ice but never break
  Where the time meets destiny
  Take your chance and come with me

Aleyah

The easy way
  Is not the way that I can take
  I keep on dancing in the sky
  It's the way
  And not the goal that will make it
  All so special in my life

Dancing on the pulse of time
  Bring it home across the line

Come with me
  Aleyah

Dancing on a razor blade
  Break the ice but never break
  Where the time meets destiny
  Take your chance and come with me

Aleyah

Life in the fast lane
  Don't you think baby
  To make it up there
  We gotta be crazy


When the daylight is falling down into the night
And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill
But it's more like spinning wheels of fortune
Which never stand still

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights

When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes
And the long night has left me back at somebody's side
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before
But it's more like looking out for something
I can't find anymore

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning
Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights

There is no dream
That you can't make true if you're looking for love
But there's no girl
Who's burning the ice away from my heart
Maybe tonight!

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning
Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights


I'm lost in your eyes
Reaching out to cross the great divide
You are drifting away
Mind and soul and body day by day

Nathing's stopping you and I
It's do or die tonight

So tell me why I'm alone
When we're lying here together
On a night that's so cold
And you're just a touch away
Baby try to hold on
Till we make it to forever
We're alive
And the future never dies

I've been dying inside
Holding back the tears I never cried
Now I'm down on my knees
Cause everything you are is what I need

You're the meaning of it all
Don't let me fall you've gotta

Tell me why I'm alone
When we're lying here together
On a night that's so cold
And you're just a touch away
Baby try to hold on
Till we make it to forever
We're alive
And the future never dies
We're alive
And the future never dies

We've got to come together
Cause everybody needs a heart to hold
Can't you see it's now or never
Cause we've got nowhere else to go

Tell me why I'm alone
When we're lying here together

Baby try to hold on
Till we make it to forever
We're alive
And the future never dies
We're alive
And the future never dies
In your eyes
The future never dies


Ah, you turn me on
I've been the biggest fan of yours
Ah, ah there's something more
So much more baby

Ah, I can't be cool
It's getting stronger every day
Well, yeah, pictures of you
I cut them out, baby

Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain

I can't get enough
Too hard a body drives me mad
Oh yeah it's like a drug
Suspender love, baby

Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
There's a place I know so well
Behind closed eyes, there's a pearl inside a shell
From time to time, I come to see
If this world still has a place for me

When I put my head to sleep
Take the rest my body needs
That's the time my mind is up and away

We are dreamers, all of our lives
We are dreamers, your dream will be mine
Forever, dream on dreamer

It doesn't matter where you're from
The door is open all the time for everyone
There's a place I know so well
Will I find you, only time will tell

Well it's been a long, long time
Since I've seen that state of mind
Right now my friend, I'm up and away

We are dreamers, all of our lives
We are dreamers, your dream will be mine
Forever, dream on dreamer

We are dreamers, that's what we are
We are dreamers always light years apart
Forever, dream on dreamer

When I put my head to sleep
Take the rest my body needs
That's the time my mind is up and away

We are dreamers, all of our lives
We are dreamers, your dream will be mine
Forever, dream on dreamer

We are dreamers, that's what we are
We are dreamers always light years apart
Forever, dream on dreamer

There's a place I know so well
Dream on dreamer
In a run down bed and breakfast
A room with a view, across the river
I tried to loose the claustrophobia
Opened up and find Utopia
There's no more denying
As my mind go flying
10 light years away to save my soul
10 light years away to change it all
Whatever it may take I gotta try again
Girl it's time to start over
10 light years away
I'd been watching the reflection
Of a bamboo in the shade, when I saw her
A very hot day in Havana
In a midnight blue lagoon
I knew she was hiding
10 light years away so take me home
10 light years away to change it all
Help me find today
It's been way too long
Girl it's time to start over
10 light years away
There's no more denying
As my mind go flying
10 light years away to save my soul
10 light years away to change it all
Whatever it may take I gotta try again
Girl it's time to start over
10 light years away so take me home
10 light years away to change it all
Help me find today It's been way too long
Girl it's time to start over
10 light years away

Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!

Ultimate pleasure is waiting for me
You wanna join in for a drive
The engine is roaring, I double the speed 
In love with the fast lane of life
Run to the hare, I'm changing the gear

The highway is calling my name

Let's push the pedal down to the metal!
Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!

When I look at you
I can see the sadness in your eyes
In these desperate times
We get pushed and shoved from every side

I can't love you if you won't let me
Can't touch me if you don't try
I can feel you
I know that you're ready to take it to the other side

Love will keep us alive

Love will keep us alive
Even the darkest night
Will shine forever

As the days go by
We get caught up in our separate lives

If you need me
You know I'll come running
Right to you
Just give me a sign
I won't leave you
We'll make it together
And take it to the end of time

Love will keep us alive
Let's make the moment right
It's now or never
Love will keep us alive
Even the darkest night
Will shine forever
Love will keep us alive
Love will keep us alive
Love, love will keep us alive

You know I'd never want to control you
I only want to be by your side

I can't love you if you won't let me
Can't touch me if you don't try
I can feel you
I know that you're ready to take it to the other side

Love will keep us alive
Let's make the moment right
It's now or never
Love will keep us alive
Even the darkest night
Will shine forever
Love will keep us alive
Love will keep us alive
Love, love will keep us alive
Love will keep us alive
Love will keep us alive
Alive
Love will keep us alive

 We'll make it together
 And take it to the end of time

Love will keep us alive
 Let's make the moment right
 It's now or never
 Love will keep us alive
 Even the darkest night
 Will shine forever
 Love will keep us alive
 Love will keep us alive
 Love, love will keep us alive

Oh, I've got a lot of loving to show you
 You know I'd never want to control you
 I only want to be by your side

I can't love you if you won't let me
 Can't touch me if you don't try
 I can feel you
 I know that you're ready to take it to the other side

Love will keep us alive
 Let's make the moment right
 It's now or never
 Love will keep us alive
 Even the darkest night
 Will shine forever
 Love will keep us alive
 Love will keep us alive
 Love, love will keep us alive
 Love will keep us alive
 Love will keep us alive
 Alive
 Love will keep us alive






Can't get enough of the girl that I love 
She's hot like the fire which burns on the sun. 
She turns me on and my mind's goin' round 
Hot lovin' woman is back in town
Well just to make me feel alright 
All night long, oh yeah 
But just to make me feel alright 
All night long
Yeah... I'd like to tell you something now
Before madness shows her lucid feathers in the Sky...

How can you lose your mind
How can you waste your time only like that?
Look at the sun inside of my hand so bright
I call it music -
And if you touch you'll see
It comes from infinity
It's made forever
You will not touch in vain
Music will make you sane
Will make you sane
Dark night! There is no light
In the realm of the black magic man
Souls flight into the cold blight 
Of the destroyers magic land
Poor man! Those spirits are stronger
There the one's who will reign
Your strugglings are in vain
Blind man! You're sucking your own blood
Soon black magic's dying
You'd better start crying
Burn out! Your evil desire
The dark Angels Kingdom
Is built out of mine.
Keep on! For the Kingdom of light
There is no darkness 
And there is no night.



Woman you can change my world
Woman you can change my world 

I'm chained to the fears
Inside these walls
The silence talks loud
'bout the things I recall
Through the bricks in the window
I scream at the world
But when no one is listening
It's hard to be heart

Woman you can change my world
Woman there'll be no return

I see shadows
Coming through the walls
I hear voices
But no one's talking at all
I can feel the madness
Crawling up my spine
Reachin' out
To grab your mind

Woman come and change my world

(Do you remember all those fears?)
They won't leave me alone
(Do you remember all those tears?)
I pretend to be strong
(Do you remember all the pain?)
I'm getting tired of the game
I cannot live I cannot die
I wanna know who the hell am I

You've never seen me
But I know you so well
And before it kills me
I gotta break the spell
The deeper we touch
The higher we'll go
The time has come
To heal my soul

Woman you can change my world 

(Do you remember all those fears?)
They won't leave me alone
(Do you remember all those tears?)
I pretend to be strong
(Do you remember all the pain?)
I'm getting tird of the game
I cannot live I cannot die
I wanna know who the hell am I

Woman I'm gonna change your world


I see a rainbow in the sky
  So many colors and the light
  I see the world and I see all the people
  How they're running all the time

I see your shadow over me
  Then in my ears I hear a symphony
  I see the world and I see all the people
  What they are doing what they need

They need a million and a billion
  And your money too
  They need a million and a billion
  And your moeny too

I feel fine though I realize
  That I don't need the million
  They are all poor

I feel fine though I have eyes
  To see my world and all it skits on ice [2]


She looked like mother nature
Dressed up in black
She had a ying and a yang
Tattooed on her back
A pretty little blonde on a big white horse
I wanted a ride she said of course

Let's rock let's roll
The party's on we're having a ball
We're gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put the rock back in the roll
Let's rock let's roll

She looked like a dancer
And god only knows
She must have had a thing
For Scorpions
To make little love wouldn't be no crime
And what came next really blew my mind

Let's rock let's roll
The party's on we're having a ball
We're gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put rock back in the roll
Let's rock let's roll

Coming together
Rocking forever let's rock
The party's on
All night long let's rock

Let's rock let's roll
The party's on we're having a ball
We're gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put rock back in the roll
Let's rock let's roll

The party's on we're loosing control
We're gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put rock back in the roll


We're gonna leave a sting in your soul (sting in your soul)
Good morning, lethargy
Drink Pepsi, it's good for energy
The bath's on, smoke in the bedroom
Sore throat, and on my neck a nasty bruise
And where it came from well I don't know
But we played last night, it was a good show
Got to play a second rate chat show
It's a nationwide deal, so we gotta go
Chuck from the Company says it'll be alright
Got an ad on KROQ
And there's an in-store tonight
Well I build things up, never let them go
Got to get time share on the radio

Look inside America
She's alright, she's alright
Sitting out in the distance
But I'm not trying to make her mine
Looking for America
With its kooky nights and its suicides
TV says it's alright
Cause everybody's hung up on something or other

Stepping off in twenty so the driver says
I should sleep tonight but I think I'll watch videos instead
Annie Hall leaves New York in the end
Press rewind and Woody gets her back again
And the whole world could have passed through me
But I don't know that it means much to me

Look inside America
She's alright, she's alright
Sitting out in the distance
But I'm not trying to make her mine
I'm looking for America
With its kooky nights and its suicides
TV says it's alright
Cause everybody's strung out on something or other

And the whole world could have passed through me
But I don't know that it means much to me


Yeah let's fly away from here
And scream if you like it
The world out there disappears
Tell me are you excited

So let's rattle and roll and shake
The sweat hits the ceiling
Tonight we will slip away
Just rocking and reeling

Beyond the point of no return
The fever's rising 'till we'll crash and burn
There's something in my veins that is thicker than blood
Nothing in the world this is all we've got

So come on if you wanna feel the sting
Come on come on baby shake that thing
I wanna turn you on

Yeah let's celebrate all night
We're starting all over
You turn me into a wild
And hard Rock'n Roller

Into the light out of the dark
A passion never known invades my heart
The universe is rocking like heaven and hell
If I'm coming back hard to tell

So come on if you wanna feel the sting
Come on come on baby shake that thing
Mama rock on and feel the sting
Come on come on and let the show begin
I wanna turn you on
Away for a long time, but never gone,
  So many good times, I recall.
  Forgive me, that I've been kind of blind,
  I've been running away most of my life.
  Girl, I wanna be with you,
  It's no one else, it's only you.
  Oh, girl, I wanna stay with you,
  With no one else, just with you.
  I was lost for a long time, couldn't find myself,
  The cry for love was the cry for help.
  Forgive me, that I've been so untrue,
  The one, who saved me's been always you.
  Girl, I wanna be with you,
  It's no one else, it's only you.
  Oh, girl, I wanna stay with you,
  With no one else, just with you,
  With no one else, just with you.
  Life's been dancin' on a razorblade,
  I had my share of love and hate.
  Well, after all I found myself,
  Cause it's you, who makes me live.
  It's only you, who can forgive.

Away for a long time, but never gone,
  Sometimes life just takes the long way home.
  You're still the one, I'm dreamin' of,
  Cause when your heart is talkin', you know, it's love.
  Oh, girl, I wanna be with you,
  It's no one else, it's only you.
  Oh, girl, I wanna stay with you,
  With no one else, just with you.
  Oh, girl, I wanna be with you,
  It's no one else, it's only you.
  Oh, girl, I wanna stay with you,
  With no one else, just with you,
  With no one else, just with you.


Every moring when I wake up yawning
I'm still far away
Trucks still rolling through the early morning
To the place we play
Boy you'r home, you're dreaming, don't you know
The tour's still far away
Boy you'r home, you're dreaming, don't you know
You're having just a break
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like
Coming home again
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like
Coming home again
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like ...

Year after year out on the road
It's great to be here to see you all
I know, for me it is like
Coming home

Day after day out on the road
There's no place too far that we wouldn't go
We go wherever you like
To rock'n roll

Jump on the seats, put your hands in the air
Give me a shout, let me hear you're out there
The wilder you scream for some more rock'n roll
The higher we'll go

Year after year out on the road
It's great to be here to rock you all
I know, for me it is like
Coming home
Like coming home ...
Leaving through the back door
Freezing in the cold
Communication breakdown
Emotional overload
Been through a wall of fire
Now I feel like, a ashes glow

Cars passing on the freeway
My mind is on the run
I keep running from my shadow
I'm not the only one
Somewhere in the distance
Someone's taking flight
Destination unknown
Just fade into the light

There's so much said and done
But after all
The time has come, to leave it all
Behind

If you could see it through my eyes
You'd know I tried to change it all
I've been trying all my life
To stand up every time I fall
If you could see it through my eyes

I feel sadness up my spine
The future on my hands
I'm standing here alone
With open arms again
Tomorrow ain't no stranger
There'll be a lucky star
And love will find it's way
Into someone's heart

Too late for tears
No time to be confused
It's just the echo of our
Swan song

If you could see it through my eyes
You'd know I tried to change it all
I've been trying all my life
To stand up every time I fall
If you could see it through my eyes
You'd see that love will always wait
Somewhere out there is my life
A new love that comes my way
If you could see it through my eyes
Through my eyes

What was meant to be forever
Is breaking all apart
What was meant to be forever
Leaves the hole insinde my heart
What was meant to be forever
We throw it all away
Was nothing but a game
Is breaking all apart
What was meant to be forever
A girl to drive a car to love
The music rocks me down the motorway
My whore's got wings we're taking off
And I can't stop this flight of speed today

It's a lovedrive on wheels of fire
A lovedrive just one desire, love
You drive me crazy babe [x2]

The city lights of London town
Are far away my hand is on her wing (on her wing)
I stop the car and she gets down
I'd like to show why Scorpions got a sting

It's a lovedrive on wheels of fire
A lovedrive just one desire love
Sweet love, you drive me crazy babe [x4]

You drive me crazy babe [x4]
Good times bad times
Bad times good times

We were twisting Chubby Checker style
In a roaring sixties summer night
We walked the moon and we were free
When Jimi played guitar
We shared a dream with Martin Luther King

We saw J.F.K. in West Berlin
When he spoke those famous words that day
Our world was not the same

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life, your life
Let the film just roll

We were lost in shock, the world was doomed
Nikita hit us with a shoe
We watched the world go upside down
When the Kennedys got shot
We were screaming when the world was fab
We had Rock 'n' Roll invade our hearts
We had Elvis, Janis, Marilyn
And hair, to let it grow

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life, your life
Let the film just roll

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life, your life
We're still standing after all

Back in the cold war
Our hearts were warm
Just because sex was free
In the summer of love

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life, your life
Let the film just roll

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life, your life
We're still standing after all

Good times bad times
Bad times good times

I'm still standing
Let the film just roll
I'm still standing
We're still standing after all
You get me loose
I want ya, that's all I do
You leave me loose
I want ya, that's all I do
Make love to me right now
Love me till I'm down
You make me groove
I want ya, that's all I do
You let me groove
I want ya, that's all I do
Make love to me right now
Love me till I'm down
Who are you?
Your magic is strange and new
Who are you?
I want ya, that's all I do
Make love to me right now
Love me till I'm down
Make love to me right now
Love me till I'm down
Since you're gone
There is an empty space
Since you're gone
The world is not the same

I go back to the places we've been
It feels like you're still there
I live all those moments again
Wishing you were here

Since you're gone
There is an lonely heart
Since you're gone
Nothin' is like it was

There are memories all over the place
Bringin' it back all so clear
Remember all of those days
Wishing you were here

All those lonely nights
I gotta fight for you, yes I do
Yes I do

Since you're gone
There is a heart that bleeds
Since you're gone
I'm not the man I used to be

I follow you steps in the snow
The traces disappear
We know what we've lost when it's gone
I'm wishing you were here

All those lonely nights
I gotta fight for you, yes I do
Yes I do



Lonely Nights

The only king of rock has gone, gone to heaven,
A star on the way to the stars.
Another king of rock is born, '77,
Just born to be there, when it starts.

[Chorus:]
'94,'95, if the world is still alive,
Will be the start for the riot of your time.
Here's a ticket for a burning train
To set the world in flame,
To play the hero game.
Here's a ticket for the future days.
You'll be the x-rock king,
The new electric face,
A new generations mind,
The riot of your time.

He's got the message to be more:
A new desire,
A storm full of life, wild and young.
"The x-rock 1994 electric fire"
Will burn out the time, like the sun.

[Chorus]
I'm a little tin soldier 
That wants to jump into your fire 
You are a look in your eye 
A dream passing by in the sky 

I don't understand 
All I need is treat me like a man 
'Cause I ain't no child take me like I am 

I got to know that I belong to you 
Do anything that you want to do 
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you 

All I need is your whispered hello 
Smiles melting the snow nothing heard 
Your eyes are deeper than time 
Say a love that won't rhyme without words 

So now I've lost my way 
I need help to show me things to say 
Give me your love before mine fades away 

I got to know that I belong to you 
Do anything that you want to do 
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you 
Oh no no no 

I don't need no aggravation 
I just got to make you my occupation 

I got to know that I belong to you 
Do anything that you want to do 
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you 

I got to know that I belong to you 
Do anything that you want to do 
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you 

I don't need no aggravation 
I just got to make you my occupation 

I don't need no aggravation

* – Песня является кавером на одноименную песню группы The Small Faces
And I see the tears in your eyes
The rain will fall tonight
And tonight we'll go to the sky
Because and we fly

All together
Fly to the sky
Fly to the rainbow
Fly people fly
Fly people fly

And I see the smile on your face
When you look into space
He's so bright and he is so great
Come on or it's too late

All together
Fly to the sky
Fly to the rainbow
Fly people fly
Fly people fly

See the rainbow in the sun
The man will not go
And the world they have no fun
Hurry up people run

All together
Fly to the sky
Fly to the rainbow
Fly people fly
Fly people fly [x2]
Open my mind 
  Let me find new vibrations
  Tell me the way I must take to reach my destination
  And a place where I can stay
  Where is the love of my life couldn't find her
  Show me the way to find back to myself
  Cause I'm nowhere in the darkness of these days

Is there anybody there who feels that vibration
  Who shows me the way to my love
  Is there anybody there with that inclination
  To bring back to sun to my heart

I find myself in a state of confusion
  Life's like a pantomime trick or a laser illusion
  Where's a place that I can stay
  Save me don't let me get lost in the ocean
  I need your help everyday to control my emotions
  In the darkness of these days

Is there anybody there who feels that vibration
  Who shows me the way to my love
  Is there anybody there with that inclination
  To bring back the sun to my heart



Is There Anybody There?

Open my mind
  Let me find new vibrations
  Tell me the way I must take to reach my destination
  And a place where I can stay

Where is the love of my life couldn't find her
  Show me the way to find back to myself
  Cause I'm nowhere in the darkness of these days

Is there anybody there who feels that vibration
  Who shows me the way to my love
  Is there anybody there with that inclination
  To bring back to sun to my heart

I find myself in a state of confusion
  Life's like a pantomime trick or a laser illusion
  Where's a place that I can stay

Save me don't let me get lost in the ocean
  I need your help everyday to control my emotions
  In the darkness of these days

Is there anybody there who feels that vibration
  Who shows me the way to my love
  Is there anybody there with that inclination
  To bring back the sun to my heart

SOLO

Is there anybody there who feels that vibration
  Who shows me the way to my love
  Is there anybody there with that inclination
  To bring back the sun to my heart








Here I am
Writing my last song for you
Hear the words carefully
And you'll see it's you
I'm leaving
Don't want to be the one to tell you
That I can't stay another day

I'll throw the pages on the floor
I'm starting over like before
I'll change this stupid ending
And stay with you forever more
But when I'm lying next to you
It's hard to bargain with the truth
Cause when you know the love is gone
The time has come to write your last song

There you are
Smiling at me from the next room
Beautiful as the first day I met you
And I'm so sorry
I couldn't be the one to love you
The way that you deserve to be

I'll throw the pages on the floor
I'm starting over like before
I'll change this stupid ending
And stay with you forever more
But when I'm lying next to you
It's hard to bargain with the truth
Cause when you know the love is gone
The time has come to write your last song

It's hard to think of you and I
As total strangers
I've lived this last goodbye
A million times or more in my mind
My mind, my mind

Oh and I'm gonna miss you
But I can't go back
Even just to kiss you
Cause I can't exist
Just living a lie
Gotta lot of love to give
You know before I die
And as I watch you
Sing along
It's killing me to know
That it's your last song


A live begins another's over 
As another day begins 
Life runs full circle getting older 
It happens to me 
It happens to you 
I do believe you're still around me 
You're still around me all the time 
I have no doubt one day in heaven 
I will see you again 
I'll see you again, see you again 

Break the bread drink the wine 
In my heart you'll live forever 
The time to go is never right 
When we say goodbye 
While we're here we shouldn't waste 
A day in life to say I love you 
It's now that I'd just wish so much, to see you 
Eye to eye 

When you came home the war was over 
So many years before my time 
I was so proud the day you told me 
You haven't hurt anyone 
No one 

Break the bread drink the wine 
In my heart you'll live forever 
The time to go is never right 
When we say goodbye 
While we're here we shouldn't waste 
A day in life to say I love you 
It's now that I'd just wish so much to see you 
Eye to eye

Let's spend the night together
  I know you want it too
  The magic of the moment
  Is what I've got for you
  The heartbeat of this night
  Is made to lose control
  And there is something in your eyes
  That's longing for some more
  Let us find together
  The beat were looking for

[Chorus:]
  The rhythm of love
  Keeps me dancing on the road
  The rhythm of love
  Got the groove that hits the bone
  The rhythm of love
  Is the game I'm looking for
  The rhythm of love
  Is the heartbeat of my soul

Let's reach the top together
  One night will never do
  An exploding shot of pleasure
  Is what I've got for you
  Why don't you close your eyes
  And let your feeling grow
  I make you feel the taste of life
  Until your love will flow
  Let us find together
  The beat were longing for

Let us find together

It's early morning,
  The sun comes out.
  Last night was shaking
  And pretty loud.
  My cat is purring
  And scratches my skin.
  So what is wrong
  With another sin.
  The bitch is hungry,
  She needs to tell,
  So give her inches
  And feed her well.
  More days to come,
  New places to go,
  I've got to leave,
  It's time for a show.

Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
  Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning,
  It starts to shout.
  Desire is coming,
  It breaks out loud.
  Lust is in cages
  Till storm breaks loose
  Just have to make it
  With someone I choose
  The night is calling
  I have to go
  The wolf is hungry
  He runs to show
  He's licking his lips
  He's ready to win
  On the hunt tonight
  For love at first sting

Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
  Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
  Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
  Here I am, rock you like a hurricane


I wake up in the morning
And the sun begins to shine
The day did sneak up on the night
I see your face and I see myself
And I get a little taste of life
I try to stand it for a while

But I'm In Trance
Hey, baby, tell me can't you hear me calling
I'm In Trance
I take too much in the Saturday Night, Hey Yeah
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling
I'm In Trance
I want to try to stop this life

I feel so sad, I'm feeling down
On the radio the music plays
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I close my eyes, I think today
It's getting better with a sip of wine
And I can stand it for a while

While I'm In Trance
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling
I'm In Trance
I take too much in the Saturday Night, Hey Hey
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling
I'm In Trance
I want to try to stop this life

I'm In Trance
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling
I'm In Trance
I take too much in the Saturday Night, Hey Yeah
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling
I'm In Trance
I want to try to stop this life
Aaaaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaaaah


I've been around the world
I've known a lot of girls
Livin' and lovin'
It's hard to keep them all in line
I've seen a lot of sights
Many crazy nights
Cruisin' and boozin'
It's a wonder that I'm still alive

Never wasted any time
Never missed a beat
Total satisfaction
Always guaranteed

Tease me
Please me
No one needs to know
Tease me
Please me
Before I have to go

Spead the world around
The boys are back in town
Reelin' and rockin'
We're rollin' with it win or lose
The girls are dressed to kill
Lookin' for a thrill
Slidin' and glidin'
Sometimes they make it hard to choose

I never wasted any time
Never missed a beat
Total satisfaction
Always guaranteed

Tease me
Please me
No one needs to know
Tease me
Please me
Before I have to go
Tease me
Please me
We'll take it nice and slow
Tease me
Please me
Just let the feeling grow
Hey you, I'm in love with your eyes
And the sound of your name
Hey you, I'm in love with your smile
And the way you're dressed today

Hey you, well I like the way you walk
Just like a star moves on stage
Hey you, well I like the way you talk
You're really calm for your age

I really die
You're driving me wild
I really die
I'm in love a hundred times

I really die
You're driving me wild
I really die
I'm in love a hundred times
To be your answer

Hey you, I said you know what's going on
Do you know what I mean
Hey you, daddy wants you to come
This school is up to me

I really die
You're driving me wild
I really die
I'm in love a hundred times

I really die
You're driving me wild
I really die
I'm in love a hundred times
To be your answer

It seems to me a nightmare becomes reality.
The last days of the paradise are gone for you and me...
We're living in the crossfire,
And we'll be killed at first.
Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world

Understand
that we don't wanna fight!
Understand
that we are muсh too young to die!
Understand
no one will survive,
Understand
that we love our life...

Can I trust the meaning of the life line in my hand,
Which is as long as exciting hundred years
I could be a lucky man?
But I'm living in the crossfire
Of a time that starts to burn.
Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world

Understand 
that we don't wanna fight!
Understand 
that we are muсh too young to die!
Understand 
no one will survive,
Understand 
that we love our life...
Force yourself to use your brain,
The only way to gain,
A lot of things are just a lie.
This world we love comes down in pain
With hate and bloody games.
A question-mark up in the sky, oh no...

Look, you can't keep away
And you can't hide
Tomorrow, yesterday, today.

Some people say:"We'll do it better",
Some people say:"Everything's good",
Some people sing:"Let's come together",
But nobody has ever brought it through

Maybe you and me, maybe you and me
You and me, you and me, you and me
Save me from myself before I'm going down
My world went kind of crazy spinning 'round'n'round
My body's in a mess from head to toe
Got nothing to lose and nowhere to go

I'm driving out of town just follow my heart
I think I'm gonna be a rock'n'roll star
The girls would go mad I'd give 'em all I can give
If I had a cheap guitar and one dirty riff

Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail

Rocking night after night day after day
There's plenty of love and no escape
Life's screaming and rolling like a monster train
Destination to nowhere I won't be late

Jo Jo I got to go
Here comes another show

Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
The job is done and I go out
  Another boring day
  I leave it all behind me now
  So many worlds away

I meet my girl, she's dressed to kill
  And all we gonna do
  Is walk around to catch the thrill
  On streets we call the zoo

[Chorus:]
We eat the night, we drink the time
  Make our dreams come true
  And hungry eyes are passing by
  On streets we call the zoo

We eat the night, we drink the time
  Make our dreams come true
  And hungry eyes are passing by
  On streets we call the zoo

Enjoy the zoo
  And walk down 42nd Street
  You wanna be excited too
  And you will feel the heat

[Chorus: 2x]
We eat the night, we drink the time
  Make our dreams come true
  And hungry eyes are passing by
  On streets we call the zoo


The Zoo
The job is done and I go out
  Another boring day
  I leave it all behind me now
  So many worlds away

I meet my girl, she's dressed to kill
  And all we gonna do
  Is walk around to catch the thrill
  On streets we call the zoo

[Chorus:]
We eat the night, we drink the time
  Make our dreams come true
  And hungry eyes are passing by
  On streets we call the zoo

We eat the night, we drink the time
  Make our dreams come true
  And hungry eyes are passing by
  On streets we call the zoo

Enjoy the zoo
  And walk down 42nd Street
  You wanna be excited too
  And you will feel the heat

[Chorus: 2x]
We eat the night, we drink the time
  Make our dreams come true
  And hungry eyes are passing by
  On streets we call the zoo


Another day no peace in sight
A solution far away
The military won the war
Certainly not for you and me

How many generations will it take
To cut the stream of blood
I hear voices that spin inside my head
It's your voice that counts so much

Here comes the young, the new generation
You are the only ones
You are the only ones who can make a change

The world looks kind of small from way up there
Through the window of our time
The shuttle broke into a million pieces
In the blue sky

The world is spinning `round way too fast
And New York City went all dark
There's a message that goes out tonight
From the bottom of my heart

Here comes the young, the new generation
You are the only ones
You are the only ones who can make a change
Here comes the young, the new generation
You are the only ones
You are the only ones who can make a change

Always hold on to your dreams
Because the world is not the same
The day your hope will die
Just carry on, for you and me
`Cause it's the spark inside that flame
That gives your visions life

Always hold on to your dreams
Because the world is not the same
The day your hope will die
Just carry on, for you and me
`Cause it's the spark inside that flame
That gives your visions life

Here comes the young, the new generation
You are the only ones
You are the only ones who can make a change
Here comes the young, the new generation
You are the only ones
You are the only ones who can make a change

We are we are the new generation
We are the only ones
We are the only ones who can make a change
We are we are the new generation
We are the only ones
We are the only ones who can make a change


Well it seems that I was lost
In intoxicated nights
Following the trace of ecstasy
With no future and no past
Just the present was alive
Like a prisoner chained on to a dream
I was drowning in a feeling
That obsession rules
'till the morning kills the creatures of the night
And I read your lipstick message
On the mirror of the truth
Now that you're gone I realize
Without you
Life's like a song without music
Without you
This world won't be the same
I need your love, every minute
I need your love, every day
I need your love, every minute
I need your love, come back and stay
Well I know that I was lost
In the nightmare of my life
Following the flash of fantasy
In a feeling that exploded
I'd left reality behind
Addicted to the power of a dream
Without you
Life's like that road that leads nowhere
Without you
The world won't feel the same
I need your love, every minute
I need your love, every day
I need your love, every minute
I need your love, come back and stay
You're burnin' my heart
You're burnin' my mind
You're spoilin' my art
You're wasting my time
No taste in your actions
No taste in your line
No tears now...
Just don't do you ever mind

You say you want to be a superstar
You're givin' up half to get that far
You say you want to ride a diamond car
But I don't like your fancy car

Hey hey hey, don't you want to see
I'm not your steppin' stone
Hey hey hey, I've gotta be free
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone

You're in love with success
You're spilling my wine
No part of my address, babe
Your ways aren't mine
You may got the money
But your wastin' my life
I'm not your bugs bunny
And you're not my wife

You say you only do it for affect
But you don't want to see what I detest
I think you're depraved
I'm gonna leave you so
But you can't see what I see so let me go

Hey hey hey, don't you want to see
I'm not your steppin' stone
Hey hey hey, I've gotta be free
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone [x3]
Walking through the desert
  You know what it's about
  It's really from the church
  Too foreign
  That was never there
  Yet you know I'm in heaven
  But it is a hell
  Sun is drying up my brain
  The smile and installations
  Are my pain
  I'm going mad (3x)
  Aaaayowwww!!!

Walking through the desert
  You know what it's about
  It's really from the church
  Too foreign
  That was never there
  I'm goin' mad!
  Sun is drying out my brain
  The smile and installations
  Are my pain
  I'm going mad (3x)
  Mad!


Life is empty, can't remember anytime before
On a plain lit cold December, see it evermore
Gliding through this life and another as a child
Ever doing games and losing things, always playing gigs

Somewhere in the sky, where the moon the stars shine bright
Where the sun is shining in the night
I am in disgrace, yet I see your smiling face
And I hope you let me share your place

I don't live today

Rain in the sky, made the world fly
Into time, back beyond time
Sun in the sky, made the world fly
Into time, back beyond time [x3]

Well, I lived in magic solitude
Of cloudy looking mountains
And a lake made out of crystal raindrops
Roaming through space

Two thousand years ago
I've seen the giant city of Atlantis
Sinking into eternal wave of darkness

Somewhere in the blue distance
Are those long forgotten trees of yore
A broken violin floatin' alone in December
Darkness everywhere and nothing more

Symbol, strange symbol, melancholy
Painting torrid colors on a sky of green
Candle breathing one night only
Far away, in chillness, bleak, unseen

Drifting galley, ghostlike shadow
Sails rigged to catch and kill the time
Echoes wandering down an endless meadow
I feel sublime
Well you know it is hard
Being a long time apart
But it's you that I love, don't you see

And when I go away
You say, please stay okay
I want you to stay only with me

Well you know it is hard
All these girls are so smart
And they see me all over the place

Well they phone me at night
Ask me out for a bite
I can see all the lust in their face

All these chicks really know
That next day I will go
And they will never see me again

So when I'm back home
And we both are alone
I can feel all you love and your pain

Woman, I'm only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Woman, I'm only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Now you know how I feel
Nothing is real

Well it's hard to say no
When you've done a good show
And they all want you to celebrate

Well I try to refuse
Try to make some excuse
But at this point it's mostly too late

Yeah, I start feeling good
And I get in the mood
I guess, you'll know what I mean

These chicks all around
It's so hard to keep count
It's like a schizophrenic dream

Woman, I'm only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Woman, I'm only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Now you know how I feel
Nothing is real

Well you know it is hard
Being a long time apart
But it's you that I love, don't you see

And when I go away
You say, please stay okay
I want you to stay only with me

Well you know it is hard
All these girls are so smart
And they see me all over the place

Well they phone me at night
Ask me out for a bite
I can see all the lust in their face

Woman, I'm only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Woman, I'm only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Now you know how I feel
Nothing is real [x2]
Out for a thrill
  Got time to kill
  Just livin' up my dreams
  For heaven's sake
  She's on the make
  A twisted vicar's queen
  And then one night we took a ride
  She was all over me
  Outrageous
  Just ain't real
  I was too wasted to see

Before you get in too deep
  And you get burned by the heat
  Oh yeah
  She'll take you there
  You know it happened to me

She'll make your heart break
  She'll give you fever
  She'll tell you everything but don't believe her
  A perfect stranger
  She knows the game
  She'll promise heaven on earth
  But don't believe her

Out on the street of broken dreams
  Where no one ever wins
  Just when you thought you'd made a start
  You're back where you begin

Before you get in too deep
  And you get burned by the heat
  Oh yeah
  She'll take you there
  I think you know what I mean

She'll make you crazy
  She's such a teaser
  Says you're the only one but don't believe her
  She deals in danger
  The girl's insane
  She'll promise heaven on earth
  But don't believe her

Before you get in too deep
  And you get burned by the heat
  Oh yeah
  She'll take you there
  You know it happened to me

Don't believe her (Don't believe her)
  Don't believe her (Don't believe her)
  Don't believe her (Don't believe her)
  I can't believe her (Don't believe her)

She'll make your heart break
  She'll give you fever
  She'll tell you everything but don't believe her
  A perfect stranger
  She knows the game
  She'll promise heaven on earth

She'll make you crazy
  She's such a teaser
  Says you're the only one but don't believe her
  She deals in danger
  The girl's insane
  She'll promise heaven on earth
  But don't believe her

Don't believe her (4x)


She was born with a song in the air 
  In the summer of 85 
  The clouds just went and the day became so bright 
  A child of love angel like 
  With the most beautiful smile 
  Growing up to be the sunshine of my life 

Come talk to me 
  Don't run away 
  Don't let the distance grow 
  The door's wide open 
  Don't ever think 
  There is no way home 

Sly*, come home tonight 
  The world is so bad, you drive 'em all mad 
  With your smile 
  Sly, my joy and my pride 
  When the runaway train took you away 
  A part of me died 

The years went by like the summer of love 
  So much changed in our lives 
  They're too may scars deep under my skin 
  Love turned to hate and hate to love 
  Let's start all over again 
  And now I wonder what life will bring 

Just let us laugh 
  The tears away 
  No more hard feelings no 
  Cause after all 
  You're my flesh and blood 
  I don't want you to fall 

Sly come home tonight 
  The world is so bad you drive 'em all mad 
  With your smile 
  Sly come home alive 
  When the runaway train took you away 
  A part of me died



* - имя, составленное из первых букв другой песни Scorpions – "Still Loving You". Множество детей были названы так в 1985 году, когда эта песня была особенно популярна


I'm not content to be with you in the daytime
Girl I want to be with you all of the time 
The only time I feel alright is by your side 
Girl I want to be with you all of the time 
All day and all of the night 

I believe that you and me last forever 
Oh yeah, all day and nighttime yours, leave me never 
The only time I feel alright is by your side 
Girl I want to be with you all of the time 
All day and all of the night...


* это кавер-версия на песню All Day and All of the Night в оригинальном исполнении The Kinks

  All the way from the start 
  I would try to change 
  The things that killed our love 
  Your pride has built a wall so strong 
  That I can't get through 
  Is there really no chance 
  To start once again 

If we'd go again 
  All the way from the start 
  I would try to change 
  The things that killed our love 
  Yes, I've hurt your pride and I know 
  What you've been through 
  You should give me a chance 
  This can't be the end 
  I'm still loving you 
  I'm still loving, I need your love 
  I'm still loving you

Welcome to a trip
Into my hurt feelings
To the center of my soul
You better bring a light
To find the house of meanings
In the labyrinth of yeas or no
For you, life is just like chess
If you don't make a move
You'll lose the game like this

Cause you, you're walking on the edge
You, you chose the way of love and pain
You, don't you see the bridge
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again

Welcome to a trip
Into my emotions
To the language of my heart
You're sailing on a river
That becomes an ocean
Which you can only cross with love
For you, life is just like chess
If you don't make a move
You'll lose the game like this

Cause you, you're walking on the edge
You, you chose the way of love and pain
You, don't you see the bridge
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again


A G-string is looking for a pilot
White flesh is coming down the stairs again
Your look just makes me a believer
Stray cats are landing in a rain storm
Crashed down lost in wango tango land
Spaced out your body gives me fever
You sex it
Relax it
Reload it
You want it freshly squeezed
Closed down the road of all restrictions
Mad dogs are tearing down the roof again
Sweet noise is pouring from the speakers
Last dance I'm drowning in the moonlight
Exit is the door that I can't find
Black out it can't get it any deeper
You sex it
Relax it
Reload it
And never hold it
You slash it
Refresh it
Reload it
You want it fresh
Got no diamonds rings
But a song to sing
Just to make you fly
Beggar or a king
Well, sitting on a stone
Sitting all alone
Sticky things are rolling down the mountain
Well, see the lonesome tramp
Who's living in the damp
Nobody's in the valley

Shine on, shine on, Sun - oh it's so cold right here
Shine on, shine on, Sun - shine on all night long

Daydreams are of silent blue
Icy wings will carry you
Midnight Sun will never shine
Just ravings of a fool you think
And laugh about him all the time 

Shine on, shine on, Sun - oh it's so cold right here
Shine on, shine on, Sun - shine on all night long

White pale velvet Autumn Sun will fade away
Forgotten life will finish now in endless grey
Some days are drifting haze
Some days are glowing blaze
Some days are tides of life...

Staggerin' along a tropic highway
Crazy lights are whirling 'round and 'round
Hell or heaven - Night or Day?
Burning fingers push the Sun away...

Shine on, shine on, Sun...
Only the Lord knows the answer
To the mess this world is in
At the end of the rainbow
We're scared to death once again

Life's getting shorter every hour
It keeps on feeding in my face
Why can't we stop the evil power
That will kill the human race

Right, baby don't cry
Keep on dancing tonight
On the edge of time

Right, baby don't cry
Keep on dancing tonight
On the edge of time

Only the Lord knows the answer
To the mess this world is in
This place has turned into Atlantis
And it's already started to sink

Life in the fast lane
Has turned into a dead end street
Let's turn the wheel back to the future
Let's use the power of our dreams

Right, baby don't cry
Keep on dancing tonight
On the edge of time
You wake up 
  Watch the world go 'round 
  You shiver 
  Feeling upside down 
  Your heart is beating fast 
  Pumping blood to your head 
  Another day to fight 
  You have a prayer on your lips under the desert sun 
  And a loaded gun 

You remember every word 
  That your father said 
  Stay out of trouble son 
  And be true to yourself 
  You'll be working like a dog 
  Raise a family 
  And life will be alright 
  But now it's written in the stars 
  If you'll make it out alive 
  Out alive 

The good die young 
  There might be no tomorrow 
  In god we trust 
  Through all this pain and sorrow 
  The good die young 
  The flame will burn forever 
  And no one knows your name 
  Bring the boys back home again 

It was a quiet day 
  On the streets of hope 
  When the bomb went off 
  At the side of the road 
  Sounds of breaking steel 
  An windshield full of blood 
  No enemy in sight 
  It feels like in a movie scenes are passing by 
  It's your life

The Good Die Young

You wake up
Watch the world go 'round
You shiver
Feeling upside down
Your heart is beating fast
Pumping blood to your head
Another day to fight
You have a prayer on your lips
Under the desert sun
And a loaded gun

You remember every word
That your father said
Stay out of trouble son
And be true to yourself
You'll be working like a dog
Raise a family
And life will be alright
But now it's written in the stars
If you'll make it out alive
Out alive

The good die young
There might be no tomorrow
In god we trust
Through all this pain and sorrow
The good die young
The flame will burn forever
And no one knows your name
Bring the boys back home again

It was a quiet day
On the streets of hope
When the bomb went off
At the side of the road
Sounds of breaking steel
An windshield full of blood
No enemy in sight
It feels like in a movie
Scenes are passing by
It's your life
I keep on dancin' on the roof,
  Try not to fall, stay in the groove.
  A step too far. I'm out of place.
  Life beats you up some of these days.
  Just like a whisper there's a voice
  Inside of me,
  It's sayin' "You ain't got a choice,
  Can't you see?"...
  Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down,
  Ooh, you better find a way around.

I keep on walkin' in the clouds,
  Find out, what life is all about.
  I keep on runnin' away from here,
  To learn the grass ain't greener there.
  Just like a whisper there's a voice
  Inside of me,
  It's sayin' "You ain't got no choice,
  As you can see"...
  Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down,
  Ooh, you better find a way around,
  Ooh, cause no one else, but you,
  Ooh, can find the stone inside your shoe.

Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down,
  Ooh, you better find a way around,
  Ooh, cause no one else, but you,
  Ooh, can find the stone inside your shoe.
  Inside your shoe,
  Inside your shoe,
  Inside your shoe,
  Yeah!

Keep rockin' in the street,
  Keep landing on your feet,
  Keep runnin' on and on,
  Still play, my favorite blond.
  Keep rockin' mother earth,
  Just all around the world.
  These days mean safer sex,
  Get my survival pack.
  My orgasm isn't faked,
  Ooh, Lord, I need a break,
  And what's annoying, too,
  Is that damn thing in my shoe,
  Ooh, there is a stone in my shoe.


You know nothing about loving
You lost somewhere down the line
You know nothing about giving
You should draw the line

You keep looking out for something
Something you're never gonna find
When will, will you show your feelings
You will lose your mind

Who's to blame my love
You play a dangerous game
Who's to blame my love
All you want is money and fame

You play, play with emotions
You need, need a stepping stone
You're out, out for sensations
Don't you, don't you feel alone

Who's to blame my love
You play a dangerous game
Who's to blame my love
All you want is money and fame

Money and fame
Money and fame
Money and fame...



Met her down at that Tokyo place
Loved her pretty face
I said: 'Hey, youre alright, so alright!'
I was sitting in her car
She told me: 'You're a star 
And I know you.'

She said: 'Take me home.
I need love so strong
Come on and knock me out, oh!
I've been too long alone
I want hot love, you know, 
And I need it now!'

She said: 
'Hey, let's go, dont put on a show!
You're just another piece,
Another piece of meat'
She said: 
'Hey, let's go,
Dont put on a show!
You're just another piece -
Another piece of meat.'

Next day she took me out
To a rough kick boxing show
Violence really turned her on, oh no!
She was screaming for more blood
Loved it more than any drug
I couldn't stand it.

I said:
'Hey, let's go, 
Dont put on a show!
You're just another piece, 
Another piece of meat.'
Said:
'Hey, let's go, 
Dont put on a show!
You're just another piece -
Another piece of meat.'
Grave communication
See me, this is my life
I'm the grazier of a new reservation
Do you feel
The floor vibration?
'Cause men everywhere
Could use the greatest scientific creation

And I say "Oooh, Oooh, I'm a robot man"
And I say "Oooh, Oooh, I'm a loser"
I say "Oooh, Oooh, I'm a robot man"
I lost my mind
I lost my life
I lost myself

Babe, it's a magic
What we live, what we do
With our magic from my generation
I say "Babe, it's not a... "
It's reality
Cause it's a robot time that we live in

And I say "Oooh, Ooh, I'm a robot man"
And I say "Oooh, Ooh, I'm a loser"
I say "Oooh, Ooh, I'm a robot man"
I lost my mind
I lost my life
I lost myself

And I say "Oooh, Ooh, I'm a robot man"
And I say "Oooh, Ooh, I'm a loser"
And I say "Oooh, Ooh, I'm a robot man"
I say "Oooh, Ooh, I'm a loser"
And I say "Oooh, Ooh, I'm a robot man"
And I say "Oooh, Ooh, I'm a loser"


I'm lost

Woman leave my life
  Woman be so kind
  Woman well you know
  Well you know
  Yeah, well you know

Zero in returns
  Zero she's my girl
  Woman well you know
  Well you know
  Yeah, well you know
  (2x)


Blood rains down across the tundra
Ice flows through my veins
As my life drains
Northern bound, my dogs are dying
But I still know
That nothing is impossible

I can feel I'm getting stronger, the longer
I'm pushed to the limit
Said I'd do it someday
Someday is now
When I see the world around me receding
No time for bleeding
Show the world how
Someday is now

Eight steps till I reach the summit
My line breaks and I fall down
The rocky terrain
My bones are broken into pieces
My mind can't wait
To get up and do it again

I can feel I'm getting stronger, the longer
I'm pushed to the limit
Said I'd do it someday
Someday is now
When I see the the sun is shining, I'm flying
There's no time for crying
I'm gonna win someday

No turning back, no more yesterdays
I just won't get lost in the haze
All my tomorrows, no sadness, no sorrow
Watch out for the rest of my days

Stronger, the longer
I'm pushed to the limit
Said I'd do it someday
Someday is now
When I see the the sun is shining, I'm flying
There's no room for crying
I'm gonna win some way
Someday is now




You never take the easy way
  The wind is blowing straight into your face
  You never ever close your eyes
  For any trouble that may cross your way
  There's no risk that you're not taking
  Not a mountain that's too high
  Spread your wings, you're gonna make it
  To the best time of your life

Don't stop at the top
  Touch the sky before you drop 

You never make a compromise
  Your will has got the power that won't break
  You never say never to a challenge
  That will come along the way
  There's no risk that you're not taking
  Not a mountain that's too high
  Spread your wings, you're gonna make it
  To the best time of your life

Don't stop at the top
  Touch the sky before you drop 

Never stop! Don't stop at the top


In the heat of the violence
  The night's exploding everywhere
  When hate pulls the trigger
  The devil comes to take his share
  In the Garden of Eden
  The time is running out so fast
  Into the heart of the demon
  With no escape our die is cast

In the city of angels
  Death is just a moment away
  In the city of angels
  Your future won't see the light of the day

Beware of the alien nation
  Beware of the truth that they seek
  They pray for eternal salvation
  They pray for your soul to keep

On the eve of destruction
  A reign of terror rules the street
  When the heads start rolling
  The devil comes to let it bleed

In the city of angels
  Death is just a moment away
  In the city of angels
  Your future won't see the light of the day

Walk on past the alien nation
  Walk on to the end of your reach
  No fear of the alien nation
  No fear of the hatred they preach

Don't run 
  There's no place to hide
  Today or tomorrow it will get you
  Don't move
  The knife is right at your throat
  And whatever you do
  There's no way out
  When the shroud comes down on this place
  To bury us all alive
  We'll know the time has come
  To face the heat

Beware of the alien nation
  Beware of the truth that they seek
  They pray for eternal salvation
  They pray for your soul to keep
  Walk on past the alien nation
  Walk on to the end of your reach
  They pray for your eternal damnation
  They pray for your soul to keep


I'm in love with the sunshine
I'm in love with the fallin' rain
Everything seems to call your name
Yesterday you were leavin'
Leavin' life and all your pain
Everything wants you back again
Wants you back again
Wants you back again

I found myself through you
And there was love in my life
I felt there was nothing to hide
And my love had a home
But now my mind has started to roam
You're my life giving fire
And you carry all my love
Through you I was so inspired
You're engraved deep in my heart
Heart, heart, heart 

My dreams recall us being warm
I've searched for you to be free
The force of life you have always been
I feel blue since you're gone
You're breath of life surrounded me
When can I join you to be free?
Join you to be free
Join you to be free

Wait, can this be a dream?
There is a voice in my head
It belongs to you, it says
Don't cry, no need to be sad
There's a way to stay with you again
It's more than you ever had
And though death brings us apart
Our timeless love always grows
Because you are my other part

I know we've never been apart
Your love sets fire to my heart
We'll burn the sky
When it's time for me to die
We'll burn the sky, oh yeah
We'll burn the sky, oh yeah
When it's time, time, time
We'll burn the sky
We'll burn the sky, oh yeah




We'll Burn the Sky
I'm in love with the sunshine
 I'm in love with the fallin' rain
 Everything seems to call your name
 Yesterday you were leavin'
 Leavin' life and all your pain
 Everything wants you back again
 Wants you back again
 Wants you back again

I found myself through you
 And there was love in my life
 I felt always naturally high
 And my love had a home
 But now my mind has started to roam
 You're my life giving fire
 And you carry all my love
 Through you I was so inspired
 You're engraved deep in my heart
 Heart, heart, heart

My dreams recall us being one
 I've searched for you to be free
 The force of life you have always been
 I feel blue since you're gone
 You're breath of life surrounded me
 When can I join you to be free
 Join you to be free
 Join you to be free

Wait, can this be a dream
 There is a voice in my head
 It belongs to you, it says
 Don't cry, no need to be sad
 There's a way to stay with you again
 It's more than you ever had
 And no death brings us apart
 Our timeless love always grows
 Because you are my other part

I know we've never been apart
 Your love sets fire to my heart
 We'll burn the sky
 When it's time for me to die
 We'll burn the sky, oh yeah
 We'll burn the sky, oh yeah
 When it's time, time, time
 We'll burn the sky
 We'll burn the sky, oh yeah
If you say we're falling 
It's gonna be on our feet 
We're gonna take it to town
We'll ride the dark side of the street

If you think we're not fighting
Like we used to do
So are you ready for this
You might learn a bit a trick or two

‘Cause all those years of rockin' hard
Have taught us how to rise and how to fall
And we're still standing tall

We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
I said we gonna go out with a bang
Bang, bang, bang
Out with a bang

If you say we're losing
Watch out we're taking the crown
Thumbs go up all the way
No sign of slowing down

If you think we're exited
I cannot tell you how much
‘Cause life's a heartbeat away
And we're never losing touch

‘Cause all those years of rockin' hard
Have taught us how to rise and how to fall
We're standing tall
When I'm alone I'm feeling blue
  Dreaming a dream of a world that's lovely and true

Faintly the dream of a true and wonderful world
  And no one will care as long as the world will turn
  (2x)

And I know a place to go to find my peace of mind
  And I know a place to find my peace of mind

And I try... (4x)


Heroes don't cry
Heroes don't cry

Standing here in front of you
A wave of joy and sadness fills the room
Your soul has crashed into a wall
Your world just broke to pieces after all

The days of your life
Leave the world standing outside
But you find the strength for a smile
Because heroes like you wouldn't cry

Heroes don't cry
Heroes don't cry

The judge decided it's your right
To wake up from the dream of your life
The curtain is about to fall
No need for words, your eyes just say it all

The days of your life
Leave the world standing outside
You find the strength for a smile
Because heroes like you wouldn't cry

Heroes don't cry

There are days of your life
Leave the world standing outside
You find the strength for a smile
Because heroes like you wouldn't cry

Heroes don't cry

I can't forget that afternoon
So many times I've been thinking of you
I'm happy that you've decided to live
And what touches me most is what you said
Heaven can wait, can wait, can wait...

I call your number the line ain't free
I like to tell you come to me
A night without you seems like a lost dream
Love I can't tell you how I feel

Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been

Another morning another place
The only day off is far away
But every city has seen me in the end
And brings me to you again

Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again

  Love I can't tell you how I feel

  Always somewhere
  Miss you where I've been
  I'll be back to love you again



We are in the ocean
  Every kind of fish
  We are a human rainbow
  We are whatever we wish
  We have been forever
  And we shall always be
  We can endure whatever
  We are eternity

The spirit of rock will never die
  Just like a rock in the ocean
  In the spirit of rock we're flying high
  Always high on emotion
  The spirit of rock will never die
  I swear Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

We've had night's so lonely
  We've had our days of doubt
  Some things we've learnt to live with
  Some things we live without
  We got no time for waiting
  We got no sacred cows
  For there is no tomorrow
  There's only here and now

And the spirit of rock will never die
  Just like a rock in the ocean
  In the spirit of rock we're flying high
  A million miles high on emotion
  The spirit of rock will never die

I swear Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

Five days a week
  Keep the spirit alive
  Eight days a week
  Forever saturday night

Sitting alone in the dark house
Thinking of you all the time
Sighing, crying
Sitting alone in the dark house
Thinking of you all the time
Sighing, crying
Aaaaah
Aaah
Dark Lady

Sitting alone by the window
Counting the stars of the night
Waitin', hatin'
Sitting alone by the window
Counting the stars of the night
Waitin', hatin'
Aaaaah
Aaah
Dark Lady

Sitting and watching the sunrise
Darkness is filling my eyes
Sighing, crying
Sitting and watching the sunrise
Darkness is filling my eyes
Sighing, crying
Aaaaah
Aaah
Dark Lady


Let me tell you something...
  In the darkness of the room
  I'm leaning back against the wall,
  Try to walk on broken glass,
  A cut so deep, just hurts so bad.
  I remember, what you said,
  Tears were rollin' down your face.
  And after all's been said and done,
  You're a woman, I'm a man,
  Could I turn back the time again?
  You must know by now,
  I won't let you down,
  Whatever comes, along the way.
  Don't you agree, that one thing is true,
  I'm not the best, but the best for you.

And I step outside the door,
  Blinded by a million lights.
  In the valley of the fools
  Another day went by so fast.
  What in the world will ever last?
  You must know by now,
  I won't let you down,
  Whatever comes, along the way.
  Don't you agree, that one thing is true,
  I'm not the best, but the best for you.
  There's nothin' else, that we have got,
  But our love is like a rock,
  Standing up against the tide.

I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today

Let's make this world
A better place to live
Start to take
Start to give

Love's got the power
To get it done
To stop the pain
Of a killing gun

And even if you say
We're gonna die today
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today
Cause love will find a way my friend
Whatever it will take
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today
Why don't we try today my friend
To make this world a better place

Let's make this life
A better life to live
Stop to hate
Learn to forgive
Even power can kill
The human race
If we gave life
A human face (a human face)

And even if you say
We're gonna die today
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today
Cause love will find a way my friend
Whatever it will take
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today
Why don't we try today my friend
To make this world a better place (a better place) (2х)


I'm still living for tomorrow

Another morning, such as ordinary day
She's doin' time from nine to five
The hours waste away
There's no escape, she's a part of the bog machine
She's a slave to the suit and tie
Seven days a week

But every night
She can hardly wait
It feels alright
To give it all away

Good girls get their kicks after six
Good girls get their kicks after six
(She needs it bad, real real bad)
She wants what she never had
All the things that make a good girl bad
She gets her kicks after six

Some days its hard to face the cruel reality
Just waitin' for the bell to ring
She wants to be free
It feels so good to start another endless night
She spreads her wings for another flight
She's running wild

But every night
She can hardly wait
It feels alright
To give it all away

Good girls get their kicks after six
(She needs it bad, real real bad)
Good girls get their kicks after six
(Ooh yeah shake it for me baby)
She wants what she never had
All the things that make a good girl bad
She gets her kicks after six (х3)
I can't believe what the people say
There's only hate everywhere
So many people go different ways
So many things don't you care

They see nobody, they see themselves
But a stage like in a show
They see the hell, and they need your help
They need your help, they need love, love

This is my song
I tell you about the story of love
This is my song
I tell you about the story of love

This is my song
I tell you about the story of love
This is my song
I tell you about the story of love

I think I need you, you need me too
The place where we live is here
The world is griping what can I do
For you and you everywhere

I sing this song 'bout the world of love
And hope you hear what I say
Forever freedom, forever love
Forever love everyday
Kick your ass to heaven
With rock'n roll tonight
I'll make this night a special one
Make you feel alright
Shoot my heat into your body
Give ya all my size
I'm gonna beat the beat tonight
It's time to break the ice

Dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite

Hit the top together
Get ya with my spell
I'm gonna make my shot tonight
Take you down to hell
Eat your meat until you're breathless
Twirl your hips around
I'm gonna break my neck tonight
I'll get you off the ground

Dynamite
You're dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite

Get it now or never
Let's get it really tight
We'll make this night a special one
Make us feel alright
Put your heat into my body
Give ya all my size
We gonna beat the beat tonight
Come on let's break the ice

Dynamite
You're dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite
You're dynamite
Dynamite (х6)
You baby, you baby
You're dynamite
They're days, that make you fly,
  They're days, you wanna cry.
  Sometimes the walls come tumbling down,
  They're moments in the dark,
  When pain just floods your heart,
  And you surrender one more time.
  Take a walk out in the rain,
  With every drop, that falls,
  Know, the sun will shine again.

They're days, you're naturally high,
  They're days, you wanna die.
  Sometimes your world goes down in flames,
  They're moments deep in love,
  But, when it breaks your heart,
  You just surrender one more time.
  Take a walk out in the rain,
  With every step you make,
  Learn, that life means constant change.

Tomorrow's all, that counts,
  Life goes round 'n round,
  You gotta draw the line.
  Goodbye, yesterday,
  Tomorrow's all, that counts,
  Life goes round 'n round,
  And if you keep the faith,
  Time will call your name.

Take a walk out in the rain,
  With every breath you take,
  Feel, your soul is free again.
  Tomorrow's all, that counts,
  Life goes round 'n round,
  You gotta draw the line.
  Goodbye, yesterday,
  Tomorrow's all, that counts,
  Life goes round 'n round,
  And if you keep the faith,
  Time will call your name.
  Tomorrow's all, that counts,
  Life goes round 'n round,
  You gotta draw the line,
  Goodbye, yesterday.


A moment of glory called evolution
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child
A new beginning, a moment of freedom
Like angels are singing a song full of joy

This side of heaven
Belongs to the children
I will be there, when the future arrives

A moment of glory called evolution
Could I fly away like a bird in the sky
No limitation, a new inspiration
A World that is free just as free as my mind

Communication
A new destination
The planet of visions is calling tonight

Another thousand years seem so long
I'm just a passenger
And the ride has just begun

Moment of glory
A moment of glory called evolution
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child
A new beginning, a moment of freedom
Like angels are singing a song full of joy

This side of heaven
Belongs to the children
I will be there, when the future arrives

Moment of glory
I saw this girl walking down the street
I thought, oh yeah, she looks rather neat
I grabbed my chance and played my usual game
I tell you man, it can be a strain

She didn't wanna know what i'd got to say
Just shook her head and looked the other way
And then she said, i've met your type before
For me you're all the same, you're such a bore

Oh no, don't make no promises
Oh no, your body can't keep

Next day, can you believe, she was at the show
She said, hey man, you're great and she took me home
She started to undress, what a shock to see
Padded bra, blonde wig, not much left for me

Oh no, don't make no promises
Oh no, your body can't keep

Oh no, don't make no promises
Oh no, your body can't keep

Oh no, don't make no promises
Oh no, your body can't keep

Oh no, don't make no promises
Oh no, your body can't keep
You can always trust 
Your inner feelings 
'cause they always tell the truth 
Where did it get you, then your analyzing 
Just do what feels right for you 

If you take life as a crazy gamble 
Throw your dice take your chance 
You will see it from the different angle 
And you too can join the dance 

Make it real not fantasy 
Fantasy 
Make it real not fantasy 
Fantasy oooh yeah 

Did you ever have a secret yearning 
Don't you know it could come true 
Now's the time to set wheels turning 
To open up your life for you 

As you know there's always good and evil 
Make your choice don't be blind 
Open up your mind and don't be trivial 
There's a whole new world to find 

Make it real not fantasy 
Fantasy 
Make it real not fantasy 
Fantasy oooh yeah 

Did you ever have a secret yearning 
Don't you know it could come true 
Now's the time to set wheels turning 
To open up your life for you 

If you take life as a crazy gamble 
Throw your dice take your chance 
You will see it from a different angle 
And you too will join the dance 

Make it real not fantasy 
Fantasy 
Make it real not fantasy 
Fantasy, o yeah! [x2]
Have you ever seen the morning
When the sun comes up the shore
And the silence makes
A beautiful sound
Have you ever sat there waiting
For the time to stand still
For all the world to stop
From turning around

And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short

Have you ever seen the glowing
When the moon is on the rise
And the dreams are close
To the ones that we love
Have you ever sat there waiting
For heaven to give a sign
So we could find the place
Where angels come from

And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short

There's a time that turns
I'd turn back time
But I don't say I can
It only works if you believe in the truth
Well there's a time to live
And a time to cry
But if you're by my side
I will try to catch a star
I'll try to catch a star
Just for you

And I run
'Cause life is too short
And I run
'Cause life is too short
And I run
'Cause life is too short
And I run
'Cause life is too short

Too short
Too short
Life is too short

Too short
Too short
Life is too short



Life Is Too Short

Have you ever seen the morning
When the sun comes up the shore
And the silence makes
A beautiful sound
Have you ever sat there waiting
For the time to stand still
For all the world to stop
From turning around

And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short

Have you ever seen the glowing
When the moon is on the rise
And the dreams are close
To the ones that we love
Have you ever sat there waiting
For heaven to give a sign
So we could find the place
Where angels come from

And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short
And you run
'Cause life is too short

There's a time that turns
I'd turn back time
But I don't say I can
It only works if you believe in the truth
Well there's a time to live
And a time to cry
But if you're by my side
I will try to catch a star
I'll try to catch a star
Just for you

And I run
'Cause life is too short
And I run
'Cause life is too short
And I run
'Cause life is too short
And I run
'Cause life is too short

Too short
Too short
Life is too short

Too short
Too short
Life is too short



Take your hand and you take my hand
Let's try to learn to fly
Hear what I say, hear what I say
Dream and close your eyes

Too much hate
Too much hate
So many things are wrong
So many ways, so many ways
Flying through the sky forever
Into another time

Yesterday so far away
Many miles together
We're looking for a way

Day by day
So far away
All the world
To do the same

So we go together
Will you show me the way
Time has gone
It has gone

Far away, far away

And today
I'll see a way
Follow me we love you
Just listen, what I say

Forget your name and yesterday
Put out your hand
I'll do the same

Now we're going to another land
Will you show me the way
Time has gone
It has gone far away
Far away
Test the mend, devil melt
Bloody money when it's lent
Scum repair everywhere
They want money, oh

Heavenly won't it be
Here's some money
Belong to thee
I will pay they will say
Give your money, oh

Obligator came and said to me
Why don't you pay your debt
The debt that you amend
Asking him forgive on his demand
For I am with a mate
Despite in her return
Remittance of the debt
I can't accept
He told me and he capped
Quite time on his demand

Imaginations came into my brain
Cause if you patients came
That brings me in my break

Test the mend, devil mend
Bloody money when it's lent
Scum repair everywhere
They want money, oh
Girl, I don't think of you
At least that's what I try to do, oh
And I just miss those days
Our secret little place, oh well, oh

But I'll be there anytime your heart
Is desperate just to love someone
I want you to call me now

'Cause it feels so good to be your lover
(Feels so good to be your lover)
When my lips are kissing you all over
(Lips are kissing you all over)
And no matter what I do
I can't get you off my mind

I just want this night to last forever
It cannot get any better in my life

Now I don't feel the pain
My world went upside down, insane, oh
And I don't miss those nights
Now maybe that's a lie as well, oh

Still I'll be there anytime your heart
Is desperate just to love someone
I want you to call me now

'Cause it feels so good to be your lover
(Feels so good to be your lover)
When my lips are kissing you all over
(Lips are kissing you all over)
And no matter what I do
I can't get you off my mind

I just want this night to last forever
It cannot get any better in my life
It's where I belong, in my life
In my life

And I'll be there anytime your heart
Is desperate just to love someone
I want you to call me now

'Cause it feels so good to be your lover
(Feels so good to be your lover)
When my lips are kissing you all over
(Lips are kissing you all over)
And no matter what I do
I can't get you off my mind

I just want this night to last forever
It cannot get any better in my life, in my life
I just want this night to last forever
It cannot get any better in my life

There's nothing left to do
But to say those words to you
Oh yes, I do
Just when you make your way back home
I find some time to be alone
I go to see the place once more
Just like a thousand nights before
I climb the stage again this night
'Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down

This is the place where I belong
I really love to turn you on
Ive got your sound still in my ear
While your traces disappear
I climb the stage again this night
'Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down

I climb the stage again this night
'Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down





When the Smoke Is Going Down

Just when you make your way back home
I find some time to be alone
I go to see the place once more
Just like a thousand nights before
I climb the stage again this night
'Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down

This is the place where i belong
I really love to turn you on
I've got your sound still in my ear
While your traces disappear
I climb the stage again this night
'Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down

I climb the stage again this night
'Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down

When the Smoke Is Going Down

Just when you make your way back home
I find some time to be alone
I go to see the place once more
Just like a thousand nights before
I climb the stage again this night
'Cause the place seems still alive

'Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down


It's your move
I'm in pain
I'm a pawn 
In your game
It's your life
I just happen to be in it for a while 

Oh, you're lovin’ me to death
You’re killin’ me with kindness 
What's behind this sudden tenderness 

You're lovin’ me to death
And leavin’ me to die
You make me wanna scream
But my tongue is tied
You played me like a toy
You made my life a mess
Everybody knows
You're lovin’ me to death 

When you touch
Can you feel
Is your heart 
Only made of steel
When you cry 
Do you ever let emotions
Break your stride 

Oh, you take away my breath
Your unexpected hunger
Makes me wonder 
What the hell comes next 

You're lovin’ me to death
And leavin’ me to die
You make me wanna scream
But my tongue is tied
You played me like a toy
You made my life a mess
Everybody knows
You're lovin’ me to death 

You're lovin’ me to death
And leavin’ me to die
You make me wanna scream
But my tongue is tied
You played me like a toy
You made my life a mess
Everybody knows
You're lovin’ me to death

You're lovin’ me to death
And leavin’ me to die
You make me wanna scream
But my tongue is tied
You played me like a toy
You made my life a mess
Everybody knows
You're lovin’ me to death


I saw the morning
It was shattered by a gun
Heard a scream, saw him fall, no one cried
I saw a mother
She was praying for her son
Bring him back, let him live, don't let him die

Do you ever ask yourself
Is there a heaven in the sky
Why can't we get it right

'cause we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon
Then why, why can't we live as one

I saw the evening
Fading shadows one by one
We watch the lamb, lay down to the sacrifice
I saw the children
The children of the sun
How they wept, how they bled, how they died

Do you ever ask yourself
Is there a heaven in the sky
Why can't we stop the fight

'cause we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon
Then why, why can't we live as one

Sometimes I think I'm going mad
We're loosing all we had and no one seems to care
But in my heart it doesn't change
We've got to rearrange and bring our world some love

And does it really matter
If there's a heaven up above
We sure could use some love

'cause we all live under the same sky
We all look up at the same stars 
Then why, why can't we live as one

'cause we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon
We all live under the same sky
We all look up at the same stars
Then why, tell me why can't we live as one



Under the Same Sun

I saw the morning
  It was shattered by a gun
  Heard a scream, saw him fall, no one cried
  I saw a mother
  She was praying for her son
  Bring him back, let him live, don't let him die

Do you ever ask yourself
  Is there a heaven in the sky
  Why can't we get it right

'cause we all live under the same sun
  We all walk under the same moon
  Then why, why can't we live as one

I saw the evening
  Fading shadows one by one
  We watch the lamb, lay down to the sacrifice
  I saw the children
  The children of the sun
  How they wept, how they bled, how they died

Do you ever ask yourself
  Is there a heaven in the sky
  Why can't we stop the fight

'cause we all live under the same sun
  We all walk under the same moon
  Then why, why can't we live as one

Sometimes I think I'm going mad
  We're loosing all we had and no one seems to care (we run, we run)
  But in my heart it doesn't change
  We've got to rearrange 
  And bring our world some love

SOLO

And does it really matter
  If there's a heaven up above
  We sure could use some love

'cause we all live under the same sun
  We all walk under the same moon
  Then why, tell me why can't we live as one

'cause We all live under the same sky
  We all look up at the same stars
  We all live under the same sun
  We all walk under the same moon

Then why, tell me why can't we live as one



You're a rock'n roll star
You're out of the charts
Your glory's cold, you're getting old
But your life is rock'n roll

Your crazy rock'n roll band
Is spinning in your head (in your head)
Each generation makes us stars
As the first five on the charts

Aaaah, Ah
And be on Top Of The Bill

You old rock'n roll star
You made the best five on the charts
You had glory entertained
Rock'n roll was your game

Aaaah, Ah
And be on top of the bill


I look in your eyes, I really think you're fooling me
You're pretty and nice, it doesn't matter don't you see
'Cause I falling in love, it happens to me every day
I'm falling in love, love just seems to slip away

[Chorus: x2]
I'm falling in love
Oh, oh

Don't tell me your lies, I don't believe a word you say
You do realize, I move around from day to day
And I'm falling in love, it happens to me every day
I'm falling in love, love just seems to slip away

[Chorus x4]
I'm falling in love
Oh, oh
I was born from the sound of the strings 
For someone to give everything
To be a song just for your feeling
Close your eyes and I'll try to get in
To waken your heart like the spring 
'cos I was born to touch your feelings

Steal the time, take a song and be glad 
Be free as the birds, don't be sad
Your time will come, I'll make you feel it
You're still young like the sun after rain
Follow the light, it's not in vain
And you will see I'll touch your feelings.

You've got your songs, they are everyday
For a while, just the only way 
To feel alright...

You were born just to lose or to win
To be someone's child in the wind
To live between your mind and feelings
Find your way, check it out, learn each day
Follow the light, it's not in vain
And you will see I'll touch your feelings.

You've got your songs, they are everyday 
For a while. just the only way 
To feel alright.

She's the one, that's what I thought
When our love had just begun
But times have changed
And I's better go
Because it's gonna be too late
And all my love will turn to hate
You've always known
That music is my life
And I live just for rock' n 'roll
No one can make me change my mind
'Cause I just want to live my life

Alright don't want me to stay
Alright have it your way
Alright I'm leaving tonight
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight

You're still the one
But you've shown me
How independent you've become
Don't tell me you need, you need me
To be your ever faithful strong lovin' man
Don't tell me I'm wrong
I gotta go my way
And you'll see, where I belong
You live your life and I live mine
I bet, you will turn out fine

Alright don't want me to stay
Alright have it your way
Alright I'm leaving tonight
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight [x3]
In the night there is
A gentle voice of silence
So low and quiet
She'll catch me 'cos I've been longing

I want to walk in your park
Cos I'm alone,
I want to walk in your heart
Where are you? I don't know...

I look around and see
The sunshine in the morning
(Shadows in the night 
Like angels by your side in the alley...)

On my journey I change the time
Leave everything behind me
(Shadows in the night 
Like angels by your side in the alley...)

I want to walk in your park
Cos I'm alone,
I want to walk in your heart
Where are you? I don't know...

Let me walk, let me walk in your heart!


I close my eyes, 
  Only for a moment, and the moment's gone
  All my dreams, 
  Pass before my eyes, a curiosity

Dust in the wind, 
  All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, 
  Just a drop of water in an endless sea
  All we do, crumbles to the ground, 
  Though we refuse to see

Dust in the wind, 
  All we are is dust in the wind

Don't hang on, 
  Nothing lasts forever 
  But the earth and sky
  It slips away, 
  All your money won't 
  Another minute buy

Dust in the wind, 
  All we are is dust in the wind

Dust in the wind, 
  All we are is dust in the wind

Dust in the wind, 
  All we are is dust in the wind

Dust in the wind, 

All we are is dust in the wind

[Verse 1:]
  Let me take you far away
  You'd like a holiday
  Let me take you far away
  You'd like a holiday
  Exchange the cold days for the Sun
  A good time and fun
  Let me take you far away
  You'd like a holiday

[Verse 2:]
  Let me take you far away
  You'd like a holiday
  Let me take you far away
  You'd like a holiday
  Exchange your troubles for some love
  Wherever you are
  Let me take you far away
  You'd like a holiday

А-а

Longing for the Sun you will come
  To the island without name
  Longing for the Sun be welcome
  On the island many miles away from home
  Be welcome on the island without name
  Longing for the Sun you will come
  To the island many miles away from home















Holiday

Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday

Exchange the cold days for the Sun
A good time and fun
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday

Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday

Exchange your troubles for some love
Wherever you are
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday

Longing for the Sun you will come
To the island without name
Longing for the Sun be welcome
On the island many miles away from home
Be welcome on the island without name
Longing for the Sun you will come
To the island many miles away from home


I saw it walking lonely down the street 
  Cool like a cat and like a crazy dream 
  I'm looking twice again and can't believe 
  It turned around and then it looked at me 
  I thought "oh, no" it really couldn't be 
  It was a man and was a woman too 
  He's a woman 
  She's a man

I think it really came from far away 
  I'm feeling hypnotised, I have to stay 
  It takes my hand and says come on let's go 
  We're going home there's nothing more to say 
  He starts to move she starts to play 
  I need a body, why not you? 
  He's a woman 
  She's a man


So here we are 
It's hour one
And it's a nightmare
There's nothing left
And yet it's good to be alive
There's no use crying
Cause the universe is not fair
The wicked and the innocent 
Are fighting to survive 

Child stay down, stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child stay down, stay down
You better shut your mouth 
Don't make a sound 

Human nature is the reason
For our downfall
And we deserve it playing God 
With our machines
Our religions are a prison
That's our fatal flaw
Bombs are flying
While we're sleeping with the enemy 

Child stay down, stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child stay down, stay down
You better shut your mouth 
Don't make a sound 

Look at me, right at me
When I'm telling you to stay down
Come to me, run to me 
I am begging you to stay down
Cling to me desperately
All you gotta do is stay down
Pay attention my child down 

Child, stay down, stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child stay down, stay down
You better shut your mouth 
Don't make a sound 

Child, stay down, stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child stay down, stay down
Stay down
There was a time when we sailed on together 
  Once had a dream that we shared on the way 
  There was a place where we used to seek shelter 
  I never knew the pain of the price I would pay 

You led me on with a cloak and a dagger 
  And I didn't know you had made other plans 
  You had me believe we were meant for forever 
  I really thought my heart would be safe in your hands 

Lorelei 
  My ship has passed you by 
  And though you promised me to show the way 
  You led me astray 
  You were my lorelei 
  What kind of fool was I
  Cause I believed in every word you said 
  And now I wonder why 
  Lorelei 

There was a time when we held one another 
  Baring our souls in the light of the flame 
  Those were the days now I've lost my illusions 
  Sometimes I wake in the night and I call out your name 

Lorelei 
  My ship has passed you by 
  And though you promised me to show the way 
  You led me astray 
  You were my lorelei 
  What kind of fool I was 
  Cause I believed in every word you said 
  And now I wonder why 
  Lorelei 

Now there's a light that shines on the river 
  Blinding my eyes from so far away 
  Shot through the heart but now I know better 
  As hard as it is to resist the song that you play 

Lorelei

A place without a name
  Under a burning sky
  There's no milk and honey here
  In the land of God

Someone holds a sign
  It says we are human, too
  And while the sun goes down
  The world goes by

White dove
  Fly with the wind
  Take our hope under your wings
  For the world to know
  That hope will not die
  Where the children cry

Waves, big like a house
  They're stranded on a piece of wood
  To leave it all behind
  To start again

But instead of a new life
  All they find is a door that's closed
  And they keep looking for
  A place called hope

White dove
  Fly with the wind
  Take our hope under your wings
  For the world to know
  That hope will not die
  Where the children cry

Na, na
  Na na na na...

Can anyone tell me why (can anyone tell me why)
  The children of the world (the children of the world)
  Have to pay the price (pay another price)

And now your telling me
  You've seen it all before
  I know that's right but still
  It breaks my heart

Well, the golden lamb we sent
  Makes us feel better now
  But you know it's just a drop
  In a sea of tears

White dove
  Fly with the wind
  Take our hope under your wings
  For the world to know
  That hope will not die
  Where the children cry

Na, na
  Na na na na...

I realize a missed a day
  But I'm too wrecked to care anyway
  I look around and see this face
  What the hell have I lost my taste
  Don't want to find out
  Just want to cut out

My head explodes, my ears ring
  I can't remember just where I've been
  The last thing that I recall
  I got lost in a deep black hole
  Don't want to find out
  Just want to cut out

[4x:]
Blackout
  I really had a blackout

I grab my things and make my run
  On the way out, another one
  Would like to know before I stop
  Did I make it or did I flop
  Don't want to find out
  Just want to get out

[4x:]
Blackout
  I really had a blackout

Don't want to find out
  Just want to get out

Blackout
  I really had a blackout! 


You're like a brother, just like no other
You keep the torch, that eternal flame
We bought the ticket, that one-way ticket
The hottest seat on the crazy train

It takes power to walk in our shoes
It takes power to walk on

We walk the borderline
Crossing those ice-cold waters
We jump into the fire
Riding the wildest storm

We rock the planet, up to the zenith
Feel that adrenalin overload
Can't stop the fever, that road fever
It's in my blood, in every single bone

lt takes power to walk in our shoes
lt takes power to walk on

We walk the borderline
Crossing those ice-cold waters
We jump into the fire
Riding the wildest storm
Doing it now or never
We walk into the light
Bringing this baby home

Another day around the corner
There is sunshine after rain
This journey is going on forever
Home is where my heart is
And I'm always on my way
I don't look back now
We don't look back now

It takes power to walk on

We walk the borderline
Crossing those ice-cold waters
We jump into the fire
Riding the wildest storm
Doing it now or never
We walk into the light
Bringing this baby home


I was born in a hurricane
Nothing to lose and everything to gain
Ran before I walked
Reaching for the top
Out of control just like a runaway train

I never walked on the narrow path
I always wanted what I did't have
All was not enough
Riding lady luck
Driving in the fast lane and just stepped on the gas

Cause I was raised on rock
My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone
Yeah I was raised on rock
My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul
And I was raised on rock

Shoot me up baby make me high
And hit the jackpot in the heat of the night
Wanna kiss your lips
Wanna move your hips
See my desire in your laser-beam eyes

You shake me up got me spinning 'round
You know what's going up must come down
Tomorrow I'll be gone
A million miles from home
The only road I know leads out of town

Cause I was raised on rock
My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone
Yeah I was raised on rock
My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul
And I was raised on rock

Growing up with the guitar men
Growing up way too fast
Follow the sound of a rock 'n' roll band
This call will always last

Cause I was raised on rock
Stranded in this town
  My machine slows down
  To take me where the night begins
  I'm playing everywhere
  Loving here and there
  I always take the chance to win
  Drove a million miles
  Gambling rules my life
  I only stop to start again

I reach out through the air
  Good look is everywhere
  Can almost touch it with my hands

Just a little luck tonight
  Will do and dreams come true
  Just a little luck tonight
  I can't stop the wheel
  That turns the ball of steel

When passion rules the game
  I ain't got no control, when my heart's in flames 

I'm a stranger in this town
  Life takes me up and down
  I'll break the score until I'm free
  Can't stop to roll the dice
  And in the morning light
  A girl like you is all I need

Don't you need some love tonight
  I do, yes I do
  Don't you need some love tonight
  How can we stand the heat
  When love is all we need

When passion rules the game
  I ain't got no control, when my heart's in flames


Humanity
Auf wiedersehen
It's time to say goodbye
The party's over
As the laughter dies
An angel cries 

Humanity
It's au revoir to your insanity
You sold your soul to feed your vanity
Your fantasies and lies 

You're a drop in the rain
Just a number not a name
And you don't see it
You don't believe it
At the end of the day
You're a needle in the hay
You signed and sealed it
And now you gotta deal with it

Nothing can change us
No one can save us from ourselves

I'm just an ordinary man
I wasn't born to be a soldier in a foreign land
Now I'm a prisoner of war
I don't know what I'm fighting for
You tore me from my simple life
To die here naked

That was so cold
Cold
Just like the lies that you told
Cold
Nothing but ice in your soul
Cold
The side of you nobody knows
Cold
And everyone loves you

Too young too innocent to know
How far your master plan would go
You crucify the name of God
Is nothing sacred

Damn you're so cold
Cold
Just like the lies that you told
Cold
Nothing but ice in your soul
Cold
The side of you nobody knows
Cold
And everyone loves you

Damn you're so cold
Cold
Just like the lies that you told
Cold
Nothing but ice in your soul
Cold
The side of you nobody knows
Cold
And everyone loves you

So Cold
Cold
Just like the lies that you told
Cold
Nothing but ice in your soul
Cold
The side of you nobody knows 
Cold


In the jungle of these times
Honest love's so hard to find
In the world of video
Computers tell you what to do
The world's devoted to the Dollar sign

Remote-controlled and on the line
Plug in man on the rack
Waiting for a heart attack
And no chance to die

No more space for love
The world gets really tough
Can't you see the end
Twentieth Century Man?

In the jungle of these times
There's nothing left for them to buy
They look for God on the screen
They've got even dream-machines
They are mesmerized

No more space for love
The world gets really tough
Can't you see the end
Twentieth Century Man? [x2]
The time has come
For me to talk to you
And I don't mean
To hurt your pride
But everybody needs a friend sometimes
To make you see the light

In the game of life
The strong survive
We're on a one-way street
We gotta make it out alive
And never let 'em drag us down
In the game of life
We live and die
Another breath begins
Another chance to win the fight
From the moment that you hit the ground
In the game of life

You're born to hunt
And never run away
And then you're hunted
By the prey
The wounded deer
Leaps highest to the sun
Until his day is done

In the game of life
The strong survive
We're on a one-way street
We gotta make it out alive
And never let 'em drag us down
In the game of life
We live and die
Another breath begins
Another chance to win the fight
From the moment that you hit the ground

Here comes the morning
It's time to play
The game of life
The game of life

In the game of life
The strong survive
We're on a one-way street
We gotta make it out alive
And never let 'em drag us down
In the game of life
We live and die
Another breath begins
Another chance to win the fight
From the moment that you hit the ground
It's the game of life
The game of life


Flying with the guys,
  And my longing for fire
  Crying like last night,
  The night which brings me higher

In search of light,
  Escape the night one day.
  She's lost in time.

Just miss so high,
  Time's passing by and I,
  I'm on my way.

In search of light,
  Escape the night one day.
  She's lost in time.

Just miss so high,
  Time's passing by and I,
  I'm on my way.


Rocked the place getting on the plane
Thunder and lightning on the way
The cabin crew told us to relax yeah
Perfect time for a birthday bash
And threw a party and we all crashed
Long before we were taking off to nowhere

Dancing with the moonlight
Should have been an easy flight
But once in the air
Half way there we went down
Dancing with the moonlight
Destination out of sight
And before we arrived
We were back on the ground

We came to stop and refueled the plane
Had some more vodka and cheap champagne
The stewardess looking so much better
Back in the air around midday
We were finally on our way
One hour flight but this one took forever

Dancing with the moonlight
Should have been an easy flight
But once in the air
Half way there we went down
Dancing with the moonlight
Destination out of sight
And before we arrived
We were back on the ground

We were dancing with the moonlight
Should have been an easy flight
But once in the air
Half way there we went down
Dancing with the moonlight
Destination out of sight
And before we arrived
We were back on the ground
Time is a wicked master
Put your life into its hand
Close your eyes and it will crush you
Rage only spins you faster
It's a curse born unto man 
Turns your dreams into disaster 

Save me 
Cause the world's gonna stop
Baby, 321 
Are you ready to rock
Come on and wake me
The final curtain will drop
Baby 321 
Are you ready to rock [4x]
Tonight 

Lies it's the truth I'm after
Let me find it in your eyes
Quick before the moment dies
Cries in a sea of laughter
Weeping gently in my soul
Love's the only thing that matters 

Save me 
Cause the world's gonna stop
Baby 321 
Are you ready to rock
Come on and wake me
The final curtain will drop
Baby 321 
Are you ready to rock [8x]
Tonight 

321
Come on and save me 
Cause the world's gonna stop
Baby 321 
Are you ready to rock
Come on and wake me
The final curtain will drop
Baby 321 
Are you ready to rock
Come on and shake me
Cause we're in for a shock
Baby 321 
We're falling' down from the top
Come on and take me
We're going straight to the top
Baby 321 
Are you ready to rock [8x]
Tonight
Well here comes my baby 
  She's dressed oh so cute 
  She looks a little crazy 
  In her Hollywood shoes 
  Well baby loves driving 
  In my hot brand new car 
  She thinks less than flying 
  Is not fast enough 

But when you turn upside down 
  Life ain't too much fun 
  I wanted to cry 
  But the tears wouldn't come 

Here comes my baby 
  She's the one I adore 
  Well she's a lucky lady 
  Born in a Gucci store 
  With gold cards in motion 
  And the platinum too 
  She jets across the ocean 
  A little faster than you 

But when it rains in St. Barth 
  Life ain't too much fun 
  I wanted to cry 
  But the tears wouldn't come 
  I wanted to cry 
  But the tears wouldn't come

Every night without you 
  I miss to have you by my side 
  Ohh, so I keep waiting, I keep waiting 
  I swear I never let you go again 

Well here comes my baby 
  With a Brad Pitt lookalike 
  Right through immigration 
  And straight out of my life 

Well it seems the friendly skies 
  Are pretty good fun 
  I wanted to cry 
  But the tears wouldn't come 

I wanted to cry 
  I wanted to cry 
  I wanted to cry 
  But the tears wouldn't come














You let me in but won't let me out
You hold the key to what it's all about
I hear your machine just coming round the block
Just ready to go to rock around the clock

He's an angel but no one can tell
He might be from heaven might be from hell

You're not alone in the rock zone
You got it down down to the bone
You're not alone in the rock zone
You're not alone

The temperature's rising put the helmet on
This is a place where I belong
Bad girl's keep a coming showing all the rest
What rock'n'roll girls really do best

Is she an angel or under a spell
I hear the devil ringing the bell

You're not alone in the rock zone
You got it down down to the bone
You're not alone in the rock zone
You're not alone

Rock Zone
Rock Zone
Rock Zone
Rock Zone

You're not alone
Hello again
You've been alone awhile
And I can use a friend
Your shades are down
And I've been waiting here for you to come around
And it's not about forgiveness
Cause it's all about the love anyhow

[Chorus:]
We were born to fly
To reach beyond the sky
To carry on forever after
You and I
You keep my faith alive
With you I'm not afraid
To rise and fall and face disaster
You and I
We were born to fly

Take another breath
Just close your eyes my love let nature do the rest
Open up your wings
And with the wind we'll rise above to higher things
We'll forget about tomorrow
And we'll live another day today

[Chorus x3:]
We were born to fly
To reach beyond the sky
To carry on forever after
You and I
You keep my faith alive
With you I'm not afraid
To rise and fall and face disaster
You and I
We were born to fly




We Were Born to FLy

Hello again
You've been alone awhile

Like it played loud
Powerhouse sounds
My body wants to rock and let it out
Really high born
Morning till dawn
I'm going all the way just on and on
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild
It's gonna be wild
Now!
Teach me to fly
Wanna stay high
I have to live it up before I die
Nightlife and booze
Girls to choose
Are you ready, baby, come on let's cruise
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild
It's gonna be wild
Now!
Getting out of control
There's nothing that can bring me down
Nothing I'll leave out tonight
I'm feeling good, I'm living now!
Like it real hot
Never can't stop
I'm running down the line to the top
Never stay low
I'm on the go
No one holds me back
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild
It's gonna be wild
Now!
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild
It's gonna be wild
Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now!
Yeah, count to five
  And I will start my car for a ride
  Yeah, a hundred miles
  And I will be at speed satisfied

Yeah, I'll miss my life
  Behind my driving wheel once it's fine
  Yeah, action time
  One only can obtain with its style
  (2x)

Yeah, it's a good time
  Time now will be mine, yeah
  Yeah, but with time I
  Gotta speed in my life

Yeah (4x)

Go ...


Down, down ...
That's bringing me down
The stars in the sky
Seem to fall to the ground.
Time, time ...
I'm chasing the time
The stars in the sky
Seem to be turning round.

Is that the wind in your eyes
That is soothing my mind?
Is that the night of your eyes
That is soothing my mind?

Round, round ...
My mind's whirling round
The moons in the sky
Seem to burn on the ground.
Gone, gone ...
My mightmares are gone
The moons in the sky
Seemed to eat up the sun.

Is that the wind in your eyes
That is soothing my mind?
Is that the night in your eyes
That is soothing my mind?

Back from polar nights ...

I was down ...
I was out ...
The nights at the pole've been
So cold without you!
I was down ...
I was out ...
The pole-star was bringing me
Back home to you.

Is that the wind in your eyes
That is soothing my mind?
Is that the night in your eyes
That is soothing my mind?


Polar Nights

Down, down
That's bringing me down
Stars in the sky
Seem to fall to the ground

Time, time
I'm chasing the time
Stars in the sky
Seem to be turning round

Is that the wind in your eyes
That is soothing my mind, mind?
Is that the night of your eyes
That is soothing my mind?

Round, round
My mind's whirling round
The moon's in the sky
Seem to burn on the ground

Gone, gone
My nightmares are gone
The moon's in the sky
Seem to eat up the sun

Is that the wind in your eyes
That is soothing my mind, mind?
Is that the night of your eyes
That is soothing my mind?
Back from polar nights

I was down
I was out
Nights at the pole've been
So cold without you

I was down
I was out
Pole star was bringing me
Back home to you

Is that the wind in your eyes
That is soothing my mind, mind?
Is that the night of your eyes
That is soothing my mind?
Walking through a winter night,
  Counting the stars 
  And passing time
  I dream about the summer days,
  Love in the sun
  And lonely bays

I see the stars, they're miles and miles away
  Like our love, 
  On one of these lonely winter nights

Dreaming through a winter night,
  Memories of you are passing by
  It seems to me like yesterday
  I think you knew i couldn't stay

I see the stars, they're miles and miles away
  Like our love
  Lady starlight, help me to find my love
  Lady starlight, help me tonight
  Help me to find my love

Walking through a winter night,
  Counting the stars 
  And passing time
  Snow dances with the wind
  I wish, i could be  with you again

I see the stars, they're miles and miles away
  Like our love
  Lady starlight, help me to find my love
  Lady starlight, help me tonight
  Help me to find my love 
  Lady starlight, help me tonight
  Help me to find my love 
  Lady starlight, help me tonight
  Help me to find my love

Girl, it's been a long time that we've been apart
Much too long for a man who needs love
I miss you since I've been away
Babe, it wasn't easy to leave you alone
It's getting harder each time that I go
If I had the choice, I would stay

There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do
I just wanna be loved by you

No one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do
I just wanna be loved by you

Girl, there are really no words strong enougha
To describe all my longing for love
I don't want my feelings restrained
Ooh, babe, I just need you like never before
Just imagine you'd come through this door
You'd take all my sorrow away

There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do
I just wanna be loved by you

No one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do
I just wanna be loved by you

No one like you


* - OST Supernatural (саундтрек к фильму «Сверхъестественное»)
Late at night when you're all alone
Take a ride to the danger zone
If someone wants to cut you down to size
You never argue with a loaded .45

Just when you've had enough
It's really getting tough

I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
Someone get me out of here alive
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
Can't you see I'm much too young to die

You can feel the tension in the street
There's no escape, getting closer to the heat
You play with fire, get your fingers burned
It's too late, past the point of no return

Just when you've had enough
It's really getting tough

I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
Someone get me out of here alive
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
Can't you see I'm much too young to die

Late at night when you're all alone
Take a ride to the danger zone
If someone wants to cut you down to size
You never argue with a loaded .45

Just when you've had enough
It's really getting tough

I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
Someone get me out of here alive
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
Can't you see I'm much too young to die (х2)
As years are passing by
Silence becomes your friend
You see the world in a different way
Don't be afraid of getting old
Life's still full of joy
And the beauty of the past
Is rejoicing your mind

When days are getting short
And winter comes along
Your life slows down and down
Like a river's getting wide
And words have lost their force
You remember your morning
Fly to the endless sea

Life's like a river in the morning
Life's like a sea without end
Life's like a river in the morning
Life's like a sea without end


Wake up man it's late but not too late,
  It's six o'clock like everyday!

Get your things run and forget the rain,
  Take powerpills don't miss your train!

And you'd like to be another
  A different guy and a better lover
  For your love, for your life check your way.
  And you like the Rock'n'Roller
  A different life and Whisky Cola
  But don't be low keep your own style
  And catch your train!

Don't be lazy man and work off your ass,
  He's the boss you've gotta do what he says!

Catch your train, run and forget those ways,
  Keep it cool it's not too late!

And you'd like to be another
  A different guy and a better lover
  For your love, for your life check your way.
  And you like the Rock'n'Roller
  A different life and Whisky Cola
  But don't be low keep your own style
  And catch your train!


You give me your smile
A piece of your heart
You give me the feel I've been looking for
You give me your soul
Your innocent love
You are the one I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for

We're lost in a kiss
A moment in time
Forever young
Just forever, just forever in love

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
Cause your love has found it's way
To my heart

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh

You make me dream
By the look in your eyes
You give me the feel, I've been longing for
I wanna give you my soul
All my life
Cause you are the one I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for so long

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
And the world stopped turnin' round
For your love
When you came into my life
It took my breath away
Cause your love has found it's way
To my heart
Into my heart

Just forever in love

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
And the world stopped turnin' round
For your love
When you came into my life
It took my breath away
Cause your love has found it's way
To my heart
When you came into my life

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
And the world stopped turnin' round
For your love
When you came into my life
It took my breath away
Cause your love has found it's way
To my heart

We took the long way
The long way home
And now it's just one step to go
All those hours alone
With only thing to get you home
Will I get out of this?
And all that's left for me is hope
Now all I'm hoping for

Is a miracle (a miracle)
To see the daylight
A miracle
The skies so blue
It's a miracle (a miracle)
To find a new life
A miracle
To be back with you!

In the darkest hours
Alone with all your fears
All you can think of
Are those happy days
So much we take for granted,
But life's a fragile thing these days
When the time is up
All you're hoping for
You're hoping for

All I need

To be back with you
Just one more step
We're almost there
To be back with you
Under suburban skies,
  Where life is bleeding,
  Where concrete skies are grey,
  There's plenty of room for dreaming.
  I still keep coming here,
  Follow those traces,
  I travel back in time,
  Remember all those places.
  Feels like I never left,
  The house's still standing
  Down by the river, where
  The dreams are never ending.
  You find me,
  You find me,
  You find me by the river,
  You find me,
  You find me,
  You find me, where the river flows.

Under the silent moon,
  This industrial city.
  Is heartland even though
  Life's been not that pretty.
  I still keep coming here,
  To that old river,
  To find my roots, just where
  The future lives forever.
  You find me,
  You find me,
  You find me by the river,
  You find me,
  You find me,
  You find me, you can find me
  By the river, where dreams will never die,
  By the river, under suburban skies.

By the river, where dreams have never died.
  By the river I look through children's eyes.
  You find me,
  You find me,
  You find me by the river,
  You find me,
  You find me,
  You find me, where the river flows.

You find me,
  You find me,
  You find me by the river,
  You find me,
  You find me,
  You find me, where the river flows.

Where the river flows...
  Where the river flows...
  Where the river flows...


The summer day is gone.
Listen to the evening wind,
Singing tunes of Tel-Aviv
Into the setting sun.
You lie in twilight sleep,
Dreaming colors deep.
Today all life is gone.

Look at the golden chalice.
Flag broken on the ground
Ringing fire, blazing round.
Where are your friends?
You see all hope,
Lying broken on the slope.
Today all life is gone.

Have you ever listened to the evening wind?
Take the chance to breathe and listen.
Have a listen and you will see, my friend,
When it's telling you the truth.


When you're feeling lost and blue
  When there is no love for you
  You'll find him and it's all right
  It's all right, it's all right

When you're feeling down and low
  When you've got no place to go
  And when no one smiles hello
  He's by your side, you know

When you're getting deaf and blind
  When you drag one leg behind
  And when you're finally gonna
  Lose your mind
  It's all right, it's all right
  It's all right

'Cause he is by your side
  'Cause he will be your guide
  'Cause he will be your light
  And you're not alone, you're not alone
  You're not alone, you're not alone



Your Light

When you're feeling lost and blue
  When there is no love for you
  You'll find him and it's all right
  It's all right, it's all right

When you're feeling down and low
  When you've got no place to go
  And when no one smiles hello
  He's by your side, you know

When you're getting deaf and blind
  When you drag one leg behind
  And when you're finally gonna
  Lose your mind it's all right, it's all right, it's all right

'Cause he is by your side
  'Cause he will be your guide
  'Cause he will be your light
  And you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone 


You have got a body to
  To make a man just lose his mind
  To give me a shiver send it down to my spine
  It's all because of

You have got a body to
  To bring a man down on his knees
  Just let me inside don't leave me begging please
  Don't ever go

Everybody knows
  That I'm under the spell of your love
  Got nothing but you on my mind
  That's the way it goes
  It's no wonder you're tearing my heart
  Simply in pieces tonight

You have got a body to
  To make a man just sell his soul
  Right to the devil I think after all
  I should have known

Everybody knows
  That I'm under the spell of your love
  Got nothing but you on my mind
  Everybody knows
  And I wonder if you know it too
  I skywrite your name way up high
  In the sky in the sky in the sky

To bring a man down on his knees
  Just let me inside don't leave me begging please
  Don't ever go

Everybody knows
  That I'm under the spell of your love
  Got nothing but you on my mind
  That's the way it goes
  It's no wonder you're tearing my heart
  Simply in pieces tonight

Everybody knows
  That I'm under the spell of your love
  Got nothing but you on my mind
  Everybody knows
  And I wonder if you know it too
  I skywrite your name way up high
  In the sky in the sky in the sky

Skywriter (3x)


Blowing ‘cross the universe
Like a shooting star that lost its way,
Looking back with no regrets,
Living for what hasn't happened yet.

Love ‘em or leave ‘em,
No rhyme or reason,
Break out to make out,
No change in the season.
Love ‘em or leave ‘em,
Put out or get out,
Simple survival,
No more denial,
Love ‘em or leave ‘em.

Roller coaster flies off the track
Hits you in the face, stabs you in the back,
They jack your right, leave nothing left,
Steal you blind, your mind and leave you deaf.

Love ‘em or leave ‘em,
No rhyme or reason,
State of the nation,
Pure intoxication,
Feel the vibration,
The anticipation,
Simple survival,
No more denial.

Don't wanna waste no time,
I'm never losing track,
I've seen it all and so much more
But I ain't seen nothing yet.

Love ‘em or leave ‘em,
No rhyme or reason,
State of the nation,
Pure intoxication,
Feel the vibration,
The anticipation,
Simple survival,
No more denial.

Love ‘em or leave ‘em.
We'd like to introduce tonight
The kings of a brand new style
They're hungry to play
We'd like to introduce tonight
The new heavy steamrock style
They're ready to play

All right, how do you feel tonight
Get out to see them write
The name of their band
(steamrock band, steamrock band)
Steam bright, work has a beat tonight
Get out to see them fry
And they will begin
Here they are

Steamrock fever thrilling rock believers
Steamrock fever in L.A.
Steamrock fever thrilling rock believers
Steamrock fever in L.A.

All right, how do you feel tonight

You can shoot me down
You can drag me 'round
Girl I'll get you
It won't be long

You can smash my heart
You can trash our love
But my desire for you is much too strong

To be with you in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell
In heaven there's no cure for love that kills

You can waste my time
But you can't change my mind
I won't stop you
So just go on

You can play your games
But it's all in vain
Cause' my desire for you is much too strong

To be with you in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell
In heaven there's no cure for love that kills

Girl I'm on fire
Heaven seems so close tonight
Girl I would die for your love
Another year is running through my veins
Some moments wasted, some will remain
The days are getting shorter and I try to drown my fears
The shadows of the night slowly disappear

Another day to leave it all behind
Good morning life, so beautiful and bright
I'm going back in time to the days when I was young
And now it feels like life had just begun

I'm on my way home, on my way home
Yesterday seems long ago, so long ago
I'm on my way home sending postcards home
And greetings from the eye of the storm

Another night, the curtain's coming down
I hear the silence just screaming loud
I can see the sunrise rising from the smoke
Will you be there for me, will I ever know

I'm on my way home, on my way home
Yesterday seems long ago, so long ago
I'm on my way home sending postcards home
And greetings from the eye of the storm

Rock the highway, Highway Star
And bring me back, just bring me back to my love

I'm on my way home, on my way home
Yesterday seems long ago, so long ago
I'm on my way home feelin' high and low
And greetings from the eye of the storm

It's been way too long
I'm still living in the eye of the storm
What's the noise who's to blame
The Maserati comes unchained
Smell the power and energy
Come away, come away, come away

You're the rider of the wildest storm
Live your dreams before they're gone
Feel the spirit that sets you free
Come away, come away, come away

You gotta live it up there's no limit
We gotta make it there's no limit
You give it all you've got there's no limit
Reach for the sky

We gonna leave for tomorrowland
We've got the future on our hands
A piece of heaven for you and me
Come away, come away, come away

You gotta live it up there's no limit
We gotta make it there's no limit
You give it all you've got there's no limit
Reach for the sky

You gotta let it go there's no limit
We gotta take it there's no limit
You leave me hot and cold there's no limit
Reach for the sky

Higher higher
Take me higher always higher
Reach for the sky



Sunday's gone
Months're gone
Some learn they're there
Lonesome crow
Where are they from
Where are their thoughts

No, nobody knows
Or even thought
Please follow them
Will surely be said
Ooooow!

Aaaah Ahahahah Ahahahah Ahahahah Ahahahah Haaaah

No, nobody knows
Or even thought
Please follow them
Will surely be said
I left you once you killed me twice
Seems like the devil rolled the dice
What have you done what can we do
To make it through

Remember when life was free
As free as our minds
Wounded hearts

Thunder and lightning in the heat of the night
Some lonely highway it's a hell of a ride
Turn it up to extreme let the engine scream
And leave it all behind
Thunder and lightning 
In a stormy night

The gun was pointed to my head
You walked away and I was dead
In the name of love you've turned to dust
What I've called trust

Remember when we were young 
And innocent too
The monsters stayed behind the walls
No fears at all

Thunder and lightning in the heat of the night
Last exit my way it's a hell of a ride
Turn it up to extreme let the engine scream
And leave it all behind
Thunder and lightning
In a stormy night

Do you say a prayer when your feeling down
Do you believe that love can turn your faith around
You’re feeling high and low, but you don’t know what to think
The world is full of saints who live their lives in sin

Don’t ask the mirror ball you better ask yourself
I think you know the answers but maybe you can’t tell
You’ll see it all so clear just take a look inside
The judge you build inside your heart will always be your guide

Face in the gutter eyes on the floor
Knocked down twice can't take it no more
You got no vision in your head
You got no vision better dead
Get on your feet open the door

Walk on down you know the score
It's a dead-end street back to the wall
You get it together you can get it all

The weak will fall the strong remain

No pain no gain (yeah)
No pain no gain (yeah)

No time for losers you make the call
Believe in yourself stand tall
Another day it's in your hand
You can be the winner in the end

The weak will fall the strong remain

Keep goin' don't ever stop
There's time to rest the day you'll drop

You roll the dice you play the game
The weak will fall the strong remain

No pain no gain
No pain no gain


No Pain No Gain

Face in the gutter eyes on the floor
Knocked down twice can't take it no more
You got no vision in your head
You got no vision better dead
Get on your feet open the door
Walk on down you know the score
It's a dead-end street back to the wall
You get it together you can get it all

The weak will fall the strong remain

No pain no gain (yeah)
No pain no gain (yeah)

No time for losers you make the call
Believe in yourself stand tall
Another day it's in your hand
You can be the winner in the end

The weak will fall the strong remain

No pain no gain (yeah)
No pain no gain
No pain no gain (yeah)
No pain no gain (yeah, yeah)

Keep runnin' don't look back
Keep movin' paint it black
Keep goin' don't ever stop
There's time to rest the day you'll drop

You roll the dice you play the game
The weak will fall the strong remain

No pain no gain
No pain no gain

When I saw her for the first time
I was mesmerized and blown away
What if she would be the one to
Live and die for in an endless love

It hurts deep inside, hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie
Inside, it hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie

Love is blind and hard to find
Falling for her made me lose my mind
Hoping all was just a bad dream
Wishing I could travel back in time

It hurts deep inside, hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie
Inside, it hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie

Everybody I was talking to
All my friends confirmed it's true
No one really was taken by surprise, but me
I was really way too blind to see
Her betrayal, the reality
When I finally opened up my eyes
The love was gone

It hurts deep inside, hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie
Inside, it hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie
The yellow raven sipped the air
  Of thunder and of rain...
  The yellow raven sipped the air
  Gentle lies kissing the rain...

Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
  Take me away to somewhere
  Take me away from here!
  Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
  Answer to my yearning
  Take me away from here!

The firebird began to cry
  When music died away...
  The firebird began to cry
  And smoke was slowly drifting by...

Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
  Take me away to somewhere
  Take me away from here!
  Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
  Answer to my yearning
  Take me away from here...


That's the stuff that turns me on
More than gold and money
I need sounds loud and rough
Like the bee the honey my love

I can't get enough

Move you legs stamp your feet
The language of your body
Is right now all I need
To understand you're ready for love

I can't get enough, yeah

Burning lips the taste of life
High energy hot feelings
Heavy sounds to feel alright
And rock 'n' roll for speed kings my love
Rock 'n' roll for speed kings

I can't get enough
I can't get enough
We can't get enough

Yes, yeah I can't get enough
We can't, we can't, we can't, we can't get enough, yeah
I can't get enough
We can't get enough
Would you care for me, if I was deaf and blind?
  Would you hear my voice, if I was always quiet?
  Would you hold my hand, if I was going to fall?
  Would you cry for me, would you know my name at all?
  Would you be there, if I was on the ground?
  Would you be my friend, if no one was around?
  Would you hold me close, if I was in the cold?
  Would you pray for me, would you know my name at all?
  Would you care, would you be there
  For the soul behind the face?
  Would you love me for what I am?
  Would you care, would you be there
  For the soul behind the face?
  Would you love me for what I am?

Would you care, would you be there
  For the soul behind the face?
  Would you love me for what I am?
  Would you care, would you be there
  For the soul behind the face?
  Would you love me for what I am?

Would you love me for what I am?
  Would you love me for what I am?
  Would you love me for what I am?


In the temple of gods
The day had come to come together
In the early morning sun
They saw that girl that come to heaven

They ask her 'bout life on earth
If it was getting any better
She told 'em someone took her life
If they could send her back
Just one more time
She knew that someone feels so blue

Wouldn't it be nice ...Hold on
To spread the wings and fly ...Don't kill the butterfly
To see him one more time ...Hold on
To be a yellow butterfly ...Don't kill the butterfly

He's been sitting on the bay
Lost inside a cloud of darkness
When I saw the butterfly
Dancing in the wind
The story goes
He knew that she was still so close

Wouldn't it be nice ...Hold on
To spread the wings and fly ...Don't kill the butterfly
To see him one more time ...Hold on
To be a yellow butterfly ...Don't kill the butterfly


I get up in the morning
  For my dose of the news
  Crawl right back in the sack girl
  Had enough of the truth
  Spend your dollars and rubles
  Buy a piece of the wall
  Build it up in your backyard
  I'm so sick of it all

Ooh, it's a crazy world (2x)

Drivin' down to the city
  Doin' 155
  Better late than never
  I'm more dead than alive
  We can find the Titanic
  Put a man on the moon
  But we can't fix out backyard
  Man we better start soon

Ooh, it's a crazy world (4x)

I don't want to hear about it
  I wish it would be worlds away
  You know the more I think about it
  The more I feel we need to change
  I get up
  (In a crazy, crazy world)
  We all live
  (In a crazy, crazy world)
  Ooh yeah
  (It's a crazy, crazy world)
  I gotta get out
  (Of this crazy, crazy world)

Goin' home to my baby
  It's been another hard day
  Bust my balls for the tax man
  So what else can I say
  They spent our money on missiles
  For the third world war
  Now they're stacked in my backyard
  We don't need them no more

Ooh, it's a crazy world (4x)


Sweet little child,
  You know nothing,
  But a cold world outside.
  You're too young to realize,
  What he wants from you tonight.

Poor little girl,
  There is no one
  You can trust in the world.
  In the darkness of the night,
  What he's doing is a crime.

Your mother denies
  There's a problem.
  She's looking away,
  She don't wanna hear you cry,
  She will pray,
  Then it's over for a while.

  Goodbye Donna...


Der Atem kalt wie Eis
Obwohl die Erde brennt
Wo du auch bist, 
da werd' ich sein
Ich lebe jetzt, ich lebe hier 
In dieser Welt
Ich atme durch voller Gier

Damn you slam you, eat me like a menue
Take it brake it, kick it to the ground
Empty hollow, it's so hard to swallow
Gotta know what's your size

Du bist so schmutzig, und doch so schön
Ich will mich in dir verlier'n
Du bist so schmutzig, wie weit willst Du geh'n
Nur um mich zu amüsier'n

Du bringst mich noch einmal 
Um den Verstand
Niemand hat Dich je gesehen
Doch ich folge nur Deiner Spur
Durch Fleisch und Blut
Denn Du, Du lebst in mir

Ammo slammo, it's gotta go blammo
Lust you bust, can I ever trust you
Scare you dare you, anyway I want you
Catch you grab you now

Du bist so schmutzig, und doch so schön
Ich will mich in dir verlier'n
Du bist so schmutzig, wie weit willst Du geh'n
Nur um mich zu amüsier'n

Hard ass lard ass, keep your hands of my stash
Holy stoli gotta have a stogie
Master blaster, buy a jabocaster
Gotta eat your heart out now

Du bist so schmutzig, und doch so schön
Oh du meine Phantasie
Du bist so schmutzig, wie weit willst Du geh'n
Bleib mir treu, verlass mich nie

Du bist so schmutzig, und doch so schön
Ich will mich in dir verlier'n
Du bist so schmutzig, wie weit willst Du geh'n
Nur um mich zu amüsier'n



Hey, do you remember me
I finally found the strength to face
The pain you made me feel
I always held my tongue
And all the things you've done to me
Are secrets to reveal

I'll never let you do this to someone else
No I could never live with myself

How dare you use my shame
To play your wicked games
With the mask you're wearing
And now you gotta make amends
For the demons in my head
I'll nail you to the cross
The cross I'm bearing

You, you said you'd save my soul
And sacrificed the innocence
That I will never know
Now it's time that you confess
They say the devil doesn't rest
Until the truth is told

I'll never let you do this to someone else
No I could never live with myself

How dare you use my shame
To play your wicked games
With the mask you're wearing
And now you gotta make amends
For the demons in my head
I'll nail you to the cross
The cross I'm bearing
The cross I'm bearing

I believed in love
I believed in trust
I believed in you
You became my God
I believed in love
I believed in trust

I was young and so naive
You were God and I believed
You made me kneel
You made me feel
Like it was all my fault
But now I know it wasn't mine at all

How dare you use my shame
To play your wicked game
You gotta make amends
For the demons in my head
You held me down in chains
And made me take the blame
I'll nail you to the cross

Love of my life
You've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me
Love of my life
Can't you see

Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life
Don't leave me
You've taken my heart
You now desert me
Love of my life
Can't you see

Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

You won't remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I get older
I will be there
At your side to remind you
How I still love you, I still love you

Back, bring it back
That’s bringing reborn to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life



Yeah!

Takes my dinner
  Drinks my beer
  Spends my money
  But I don't care

She's my love
  She's my dear
  Love is here
  I was there

Ahhh!
  Yeah!


Sometimes I walk mysterious places
Hear voices that talk without a word to say
Sometimes I hear the echoes of laughter
In the twilight of affairs and other tragedies

A half-moon away, way too close to heaven
She had the Iook, but no morality
Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment
But there are nights you regret eternally

Whatever frozen hearts can do
Will melt the ice away

How you know what it's like
When good luck has changed the sides
And no sun shines in the dark and no angels
Ever hear your prayers in the night
When your fears come up your spine
When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart

When you get crushed in a house of cards
House of cards

It's so hard to find a way when life is in pieces
And the taste of a kiss is so bittersweet
Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment
But the man who'll rise up from the ashes is no one else but me

I'm standing in a waterfall
To wash the lies away

How you know what it's like
When good luck has changed the sides
And no sun shines in the dark and no angels
Ever hear your prayers in the night
When your fears come up your spine
When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart
House of cards

Whatever frozen hearts can do
Will melt the ice away...

We come to you through a storm of lightning
To drive this place totally insane
Another show that really keeps us fighting
For what it takes to blow your mind away

Hey you, are you ready for tonight
Can you hear me now
Let me hear you too

We come to you through a wall of thunder
Electrified by the sound of the Guitars
Hey you, are you ready for tonight
Can you see me now
I wanna see you out there

We let it rock to free your energy
You let it roll, come on get on your feet
We let it rock to feed your hungry dreams
You let it roll, up to the ecstasy

We come to you through a burst of fire
Energized by the feedback of the crowd
Hey you, are you ready for tonight
Can you feel me now
Can you feel the groove

We let it rock to free your energy
You let it roll, come on get on your feet
We let it rock to feed your hungry dreams
You let it roll, up to the ecstasy
Sometimes there's a time you must say goodbye
Though it hurts you must learn to try
I know I've got to let you go
But I know anywhere you go

You'll never be far
'Cause like the light of a bright star
You'll keep shining in my life
You're gonna be right

Here in my heart
That's where you'll be
You'll be with me
Here in my heart
No distance can keep us apart
Long as you're here in my heart

Won't be any tears falling from these eyes
'Cause when love's true love never dies
It stays alive forever
Time can't take away what love we had
I will remember our time together
You might think our time is through
But I'll still have you

Here in my heart
That's where you'll be
You'll be with me
Here in my heart
No distance can keep us apart
Long as you're here in my heart

I know you'll be back again
And 'till then
My love is waiting

Here in my heart
That's where you'll be
You'll be with me
Here in my heart
No distance can keep us apart
Long as you're here in my heart

Here in my heart
That's where you'll be
You'll be with me
Here in my heart
No distance can keep us apart
Long as you're here in my heart



Here In My Heart

Fire in her eyes ... burn ...
Perfume of the skies ...
Fingers cold as ice ... freeze ...
Devil in disguise!

Well, she's a, she's a, she's a
You know that she's a hell-cat, hell-cat, hell-cat, hell-cat
(She's gonna scratch up your mind ...)
You know that guy with piccadilly-eyes
Was talking to the French boy
But didn't realize.
Banana-long-boat-eating
An' he tried to get a wife
But he couldn't stay alive
Well, you know that lad with the rubber-dad
Paints his fingers yellow, blue, and red.
An' you also know that she's a liar
Knowing only her desire ...
She likes it hot, she likes it humid
  She likes my cake, and she's not stupid
  She likes my sugar, she likes my bread
  I'm ready to attack
  She comes at night, when I'm asleep
  Without a sound, just like a thief
  She comes to crawl, under my bed
  I'm ready to attack

Priscilla oh Priscilla
  You last resistant chiller
  Priscilla oh Priscilla
  Tonight I'm going to kill ya

She lives in my kitchen
  Down in the shade
  She likes leftovers
  And throwaways
  I'm on a diet
  And she is fat
  I'm ready to attack

Priscilla oh Priscilla
  You last resistant chiller
  Priscilla oh Priscilla
  Tonight I'm going to kill ya

I can't do it I can't do it at all
  She turns a man into killer
  This cockroach named Priscilla
  This cockroach named Priscilla

You're gonna be here
  You're gonna be there
  You're gonna be everywhere
  I'm coming after you
  I'm coming after you
  You're gonna be now
  You're gonna be then
  You're gonna be out and in
  I'm coming after you
  I'm coming after you
  You're gonna be saint
  You're gonna be sin
  You're gonna lose and win
  I'm coming after you
  I'm coming after you

Priscilla oh Priscilla
  Tonight I'm going to kill ya


I'm standing with the rank-n-file,
I'm marching with the underground,
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves!

Let my imagination go and drop me where I feel most scared. 
Snap back already giving thanks, 
I'm not trapped working in a sweatshop somewhere.
This song's for those less fortunate, 
Locked in a world where both ends aren't meant to meet.

I'm standing with the rank-n-file, 
I'm marching with the underground, 
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves.
I'm standing with the rank-n-file, 
I'm marching with the underground, 
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves!

Let my imagination go and drop me where I feel most scared. 
Synaptic flashes in my head then total thanks again, 
I'm not soldiering somewhere. 
This song is for the countless souls, 
Who died in vain for someone else's gain.

I'm standing with the rank-n-file, 
I'm marching with the underground, 
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves.
I'm standing with the rank-n-file, 
I'm marching with the underground, 
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves.

Left my birthplace for foreign streets to strange places, new faces I flew.
Shoeless kids stood on the corner, 
Their eyes they were transfixed on you.

So I'm standing with the rank-n-file, 
I'm marching with the underground,
Oh my black heart worn on my sleeve. 
I'm standing with the rank-n-file, 
I'm marching with the underground, 
With our black hearts worn on our sleeves, alright!

[2x:]
I'm standing with the rank-n-file, 
I'm marching with the underground, 
our black hearts worn on our sleeves.
I'm standing with the rank-n-file, 
I'm marching with the underground, 
our black hearts worn on our sleeves.
That alarm clock ringin' in your ear,
Radio playing sports report cheer,
But you got nothing to cheer or shout about,
Just a nine to five in a lousy town.

Your morning begins,
With you thinkin' of the cold of the street blown' in your face.

Your morning begins with you thinkin':
“One more day in this job and I'm gonna scream!”

So stand up
And step out,
Step out to the new sound.

Stand up.
Step out.
Step out to the new sound.

“Hello!” to the manager, “Hello!” to the boss.
As they sell you short and they drink your blood
You give ‘em your heart and your very soul
Only to realize that they don't give a fuck about you!

Your morning begins, 
With you thinkin' of the cold of the street blowing in your face.

Your morning begins with you thinkin':
“One more day in this life and I'm gonna scream!”

So stand up,
Step out,
Step out to the new sound.

Stand up.
Step out.
Step out to the new sound.

And when they try to put you down put you on your back,
But you don't take that you knock ‘em out!

Stand up.
Step out.
Step out to the new sound

Stand up.
Step out.
Step out to the new sound

Stand up.
Step out.
Step out to the new sound

Stand up.
Step out.
Step out to the new sound

Stand up.
Step out.
Step out to the new sound
I point the finger at you. 
Scream until my face is blue. 
But you still hate everything.

I point the finger at you. 
The Beau monde through and through. 
You still hate everything.

Turn the lights on. 
Watch them scatter. 
Exterminate the idle chatter.

I point the finger at you. 
Until you're cold, dead and blue. 
But you still hate everything.

If you're right it feels good to be wrong. 
Raised fist and a fuck you song. 
If you're right it feels good to be wrong. 
Slaughtering the pigs. 
How do you sleep?

I point the finger at you. 
You don't have a fucking clue. 
But you still hate everything;

I point the finger at you. 
Doesn't matter what I do. 
Cause you still hate everything.

Turn the lights on. 
Watch them scatter. 
Exterminate the idle chatter.

I point the finger at you. 
Lie and lie until it's truth. 
But you still hate everything.

If you're right it feels good to be wrong. 
Raised fist and a fuck you song. 
If you're right it feels good to be wrong. 
Slaughtering the pigs. 
How do you sleep?

No change. 
No shift. 
No rest.

There is no war without warriors. 
How do you sleep? 
How do you plead?
Nailed to the cross, dead for collective sin
We decide where, why, who and when
Build our bibles to ONLY include
The things that we believe to be divine and true

This is our right
This is our life
Everyone homogenized

Sodom, Gomorrah, Washington D.C.
Smited into oblivion with blood, wrath and disease
Sheep in shepherd's clothing

Allah, Jesus, and Muhammad
Their words have way more in common
Than the Midwest or the Middle East like to preach
It's a tragedy
It's a strategy
To prey on contrast, to not indulge fact
Divide, conquer and subcontract

Sodom, Gomorrah, Washington DC
Smited into oblivion with blood, wrath and disease
Sheep in shepherd's clothing
Sheep in shepherd's clothing

The scriptures, blind followers read
Are not as cryptic as they seem
The pages serve the sick and the poor 
Not to serve the capitalists of endless war

Sodom, Gomorrah, Washington DC
Smited into oblivion with blood, wrath and disease
Sheep in shepherd's clothing
Sheep in shepherd's clothing
Sheep in shepherd's clothing

Religion is the opiate of the weak
[2x:]
  You'll get yours when you're good and ready
  You'll get yours and go straight to hell
  And when that day comes
  You can be good and sure
  The day belongs to us

The sign said: "detour" so I did
  And I found myself in a wonderful place
  Fields of green when the wind blows cold 
  The kind of place one could grow old

Sky opened up (yeah!)
  Sun showered down (aww!)
  Onto a row of wooden pikes
  What an awe-inspiring sight
  Birds shy on top of them
  Puts your head in a beautiful state

[2x:]
  You'll get yours when you're good and ready
  You'll get yours and go straight to hell
  And when that day comes
  You can be good and sure
  The day belongs to us

Life is a horror show and baby it will never stop
  They tell me watch my step
  I answer back: "You watch your mouth!"
  So many stories you have told
  You and stories have grown old

SOS... who will save our ship?
  SOS... who gives a shit?
  Sinking like a rock with a heart of coal
  Sinking like a rock without a soul
  Please note: don't underestimate me
  Cause I'm a cruel motherfucker!

[2x:]
  You'll get yours when you're good and ready
  You'll get yours and go straight to hell
  And when that day comes
  You can be good and sure
  The day belongs to us

The new dawn starts this day
  As strange and savage poetry make up your eulogy
  Tables turned around and turned on you
  No one sheds a tear

No one loses sleep
  You disappear

[3x:]
  We fall asleep
  You disappear

We fall asleep... We fall...

You'll get yours when you're...
  You'll get yours when you're...
  You'll get yours when you're...

[2x:]
  You'll get yours when you're good and ready
  You'll get yours and go straight to hell
  And when that day comes
  You can be good and sure
  The day belongs to us

Yeah!



Good And Ready

[2x:]
  You'll get yours when you're good and ready
  You'll get yours and go straight to hell
  And when that day comes
  You can be good and sure
  The day belongs to us

The sign said: "detour" so I did
  And I found myself in a wonderful place
  Fields of green when the wind blows cold 
  The kind of place one could grow old

Sky opened up (yeah!)
  Sun showered down (aww!)
  Onto a row of wooden pikes
  What an awe-inspiring sight
  Birds shy on top of them
  Puts your head in a beautiful state

[2x:]
  You'll get yours when you're good and ready
  You'll get yours and go straight to hell
  And when that day comes
  You can be good and sure
  The day belongs to us

  I answer back: "You watch your mouth!"
  So many stories you have told

The Anarchists are buzzin' like bees around a hive
As protesters hit the streets with signs, signs, signs
The dissent of the world has filled us to the brim
But some will still cast their ballots
Based on those who live in sin.

It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable to watch the system crumble
This political shakedown, coming correct from the underground
This political shakedown, coming correct from the underground
We've been cut up
We've been shut up
For far too long, yeah!

Pull the feeding tube out of the mouth of democracy
Televise it starving to death
Once buried in the ground
We can all breathe free
We can all breathe free

It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable to watch the system crumble
This political shakedown, coming correct from the underground
This political shakedown, coming correct from the underground
We've been cut up
We've been shut up
For far too long, yeah!

(It's unbelievable, whoa oh whoa oh-oh)
(It's unbelievable, whoa oh whoa oh-oh)

Policeman takes his club to a head (It's unbelievable, whoa oh whoa oh-oh)
Just like he's beating the drum
The news reporters dance like hell (It's unbelievable, whoa oh whoa oh-oh)
..To the sounds.

Policeman takes his club to a head (It's unbelievable, whoa oh whoa oh-oh)
Just like he's beating the drum
The news reporters dance like hell (It's unbelievable, whoa oh whoa oh-oh)
..To the sounds.
[Chorus:]
You've gotta die, gotta die, 
Gotta die for your government! 
Die for your country! That's shit! 
You've gotta die, gotta die, 
Gotta die for your government! 
Die for your country! That's shit! 

There's a Gulf War vet, 
Dying a slow, cold death 
And the government says, 
"We don't know the source of his sickness" 
But don't believe what they say, 
Because your government is lying, 
They've done it before 
And don't you know they'll do it again, 
A secret test, government built virus 
"Subject Test Group: Gulf Battle Field Troops" 

[Chorus]

First World War vets slaughtered 
By General Eisenhower, 
You give them your life, 
They give you a stab in the back, 
Radiation, agent orange, tested on US souls, 
Guinea pigs for Western corporations, 
I never have, I never will 
Pledge allegiance to their flag, 
You're getting used, you'll end up dead! 

[Chorus]

I don't need you to tell me what to do 
And I don't need you to tell me what to be... Fuck you! 
I don't need you to tell me what to say 
And I don't need you to tell me 
What to think! What to think! 
What to think, what to think, 
Think, think, think! 

[Chorus]




Times up! 
You're outta luck and your back's up against the wall.
From Tunisia to Washington the people are calling: “No!”

Your gas n guns, your clubs n thugs, your lies on the TV,
None of that can save you now as your reign is swept away.

Get up! Get up! 
Your voices are needed. 
Become, become the pulse of the revolution,
In the ranks of the masses risin'.

Get up! Get up! 
Your voices are needed. 
Become, become the pulse of the revolution,
In the ranks of the masses risin'.

Another shakedown and a slap in the face,
and he know he'd had had enough.
He doused himself in gasoline, took a breath, and lit a match.

She said: “I will go down to Tehrir Square and I will stand alone,
And if you have any dignity, I won't be on my own.”

Get up! Get up! 
Your voices are needed. 
Become, become the pulse of the revolution,
In the ranks of the masses risin'. 

Get up! Get up! 
Your voices are needed. 
Become, become the pulse of the revolution,
In the ranks of the masses risin'.

Woho!
Hey!

Woho!
Hey!

Woho!
Hey!

Woho!
Hey!

Hey!

Get up! Get up! 
Your voices are needed. 
Become, become the pulse of the revolution,
In the ranks of the masses risin'. 

Get up! Get up! 
Your voices are needed. 
Become, become the pulse of the revolution,
In the ranks of the masses risin'.

Get up! Get up! 
Your voices are needed. 
Become, become the pulse of the revolution,
In the ranks of the masses risin'. 
In the ranks of the masses risin'!

Hey! Hey!
Woho! Woho!

Hey! Hey!
Woho! Woho!

Hey! Hey!
Woho! Woho!

 First they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out.
 Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out.
 Next they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out.
 And then they came for me!

 This is autonomy  (My American Dream)
 Stepped over on the street (Stars and stripes blinding me)
 Their contagious air we breath (My American Dream)
 Classism the black plague (Will mark your grave)

 This is the second time, we will not fall in line, 
 No you can't stop this exodus
 No you won't stop this exodus.
 No you can't stop this exodus
 No you won't stop this exodus.

 A hooded prisoner on the bay (These truths let freedom ring)
 A child Darfur refugee (Home of the free and brave)
 The ghosts of war who will not sleep (These truths let freedom ring)
 The poor who drown in bigotry (Will mark your grave)

 This is the second time, yeah, it's the second time, we will not fall in line,
 No you can't stop this exodus
 No you won't stop this exodus.
 No you can't stop this exodus
 No you won't stop this exodus.

 Fight forever more (The movement of the people)

Recruited by the NSA, my orders to talk smooth and straight
  If heads of state try to say "No", I lovingly told them "Fuck you!"
  The jackals lose when I cannot (get through)
  There is a windfall of profit to (get to)
  You better deal or we're gonna take you down

And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
  The iron fist for blood and empire, will make you move
  And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
  The iron fist for blood and empire, will make you move
  So dance with me

Arbenz, Mossadeq, Allende, Roldos, Torrijos, Aristide
  Elected democratically, all snuffed out by the CIA
  The truth will cause your heart to seize
  Shed light on the true enemy

And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
  The iron fist for blood and empire, will make you move
  And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
  The iron fist for blood and empire, will make you move

What have we done? (You don't know)
  Until you care (You never will)
  What have we done? (You don't know)
  Until you care (You never will)

The crimes, the murder, unjust, unheard of
  The crimes, the murder, what have we done?

And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
  The iron fist for blood and empire, will make you move
  And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
  The iron fist for blood and empire, will make you move
  So dance with me












I always thought 
If you want to change the world 
Then you have to start with yourself 
So if the heads of state 
Want to end terrorism 
They should go ahead 
And kill themselves 

I will not sign my blind faith away 
To an unjustly leader 
Of the unjust police state 
Corporate masters live in their cess pool 
Of extreme wealth and excess 

The phrase world leaders 
Does not describe the heads of state 
Those few in power 
Work only 
For the corporate sake 
No action, no interest, 
No humanity at all 
As the corporate towers 
Rise up 
They watch the people fall 

A governement run 
By the corporations of the world 
Enslaving mothers, fathers, 
Sons, and daughters 
Profits put before people 
Equal force, equal reaction 
Equal suppression, equal intimidations 
Equal propaganda, equal rebellion 

We've got to make a change 
No religions, 
Sexual preference 
And regardless of your race 
We've got to make a change 
No war, corporate run 
Governements, 
No police state 
We've got to make a change 
For the good of the human race 
And you still look me in the eye 
And you still wonder why 
Your cities fucking burn 

No borders, no nations 
No flags, no patriots
You want to save the world? 
I can tell you what to do! 
You want to end terror? 
This solution is for you! 
Answer the call up join the proud the few 
Pull on the trigger with your heart and soul 
Cause war is peace now we know

[Chorus:]
Fight fire with fire! 
Douse violent flames with gasoline 
Fight fire with fire! 
Spite your foe with an all out holocaust! 
Fight fire with fire! 
Pour gasoline on the world inferno, 
Burn it so hot that the world incinerates 
When they're all dead 
We'll have no issues to resolve

To end terror it takes a special skill 
Кill, kill, kill! 
Till there's nothing left to kill!! 
Don't question orders- 
Do your job and move, 
It's a 9 to 5 and 5 to 9 
To makes sure no one's left alive 

[Chorus]

Join now! Don't wait! 
Make death your date!
Salute and fight! 
Fight for the wealth of the few
Wrapped in a flag and sold to you,
Sold as Freedom, 
It's up to you to see through lies 
By those who've led us to endless world strife,
What this world needs is something new! 
What this world needs right now is you! 
Any dumbfuck can murder kill, kill, kill!
[U.S. Representative, Jim McDermott:]
"Depleted Uranium is used on the ends of bullets 
and on the ends of shells because it is so hard.
Almost any armament is vulnerable to something that is tipped with Depleted Uranium."

In the cities and towns of Afghanistan
In the heart of the Balkans - the heart of Iraq
Not your Grandfather's style of deadly munitions
It's silent and deadly long after the mission

Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime

Gonna cut through their armor, then cut through your lungs
If you make it home alive you'll still die young
A greedy gang of liars, yeah we've seen it all before
A moneymaking scheme led by war-profiteering whores

Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime

[U.S. Representative, Jim McDermott:]
"They were throwing it away until they figured out they could use it for armament."

Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - You'll waste away
Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - You'll waste a...

We've heard their lies before and we know they're lying again
Feels like a dcj vu of Agent Orange and Vietnam
Weaponry so sadistic it is hard to comprehend
War profits surge with every breath by Uncle Sam

Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime

[U.S. Representative, Jim McDermott:]
"We went to a hospital in Southern Iraq, 
and a woman was there with a very deformed child and 
her husband had been in the Iraqi Army and had been 
in the battles in Southern Iraq and 
came home and they produced a baby with very severe 
malformations... Both the Leukemia rates in children and 
malformations at birth had increased by 600% 
and it was clearly an epidemic where all this 
DU had been dumped... It becomes a dust that can be 
inhaled and infect the blood stream and the rest 
of the body and it was the opinion of the 
doctors there that this was caused by depleted uranium...
They simply saw this as being a direct result of the 
war by United States."

Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - We waste away
Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - We waste away
Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - We waste away
Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - We waste away

[U.S. Representative, Jim McDermott:]
"The doctor said, 
'Women {in Iraq} at the time of birth don't ask if 
it's a boy or a girl, they ask: Is it normal?'
...The military denies first, and then after the evidence
builds to the point where they can no longer deny, 
then they do the research. That's what happened in the 
Vietnam era around Agent Orange and I suspect and 
I'm worried that that's what will happen this time."

I did my best to make it in the world, 
I plowed by sweat in tears into the fertile 
Generation, generation generated 
What was needed for supply to meet demand 

The sun shone bright on the ancient range, 
Then the promise of the future 
Turned the Neo-Liberal Plan, 
The people's voice shut up, shut down, abstain 
Is it gonna take a martyr to end the charade? 

They tell you that you're out of luck 
While people fall 
They watch their profits rocket up 

[Chorus:]
S.O.S., this is a global call, 
You better make a stand, 
You better make it now, 
Take back your rights from the IMF, 
World Bank and Monsanto 
S.O.S., this is a global call, 
You better make a stand, 
You better make it now, 
Corporatocracy leads to profits for killers, 
Profits for killers, no! 

Geneva to Washington, Cancun to Seoul 
The Corporate Welfare State 
Running out of control, 
The Corprocrats have got the guns, 
But their numbers are few, 
They can kill democracy, 
But they cannot kill the truth 

(So!) Step out on the matrix of the corporate slave 
(So!) Step into the world of the living wage 
Not for one, not for two, not for three or four 
But for every single citizen around the fucking world 

The people in the fight of our lives 
The spark of revolution in a farmers' suicide 

[Chorus]

When they wage war on you, you lay asleep, 
When they poison your food, you choose to drink 
There's poison in the well! 

Yeah! 

(Stand Up! Resist!) 
Monsanto are killers, k-k-k-k-killers 
(Stand Up! Resist!) 
Syngenta are killers, k-k-k-k-killers 
(Stand Up! Resist!) 
The World Bank are killers, k-k-k-k-killers (Stand Up! Resist!) 
(Stand Up! Resist!) 
The WTO are killers, k-k-k-k-killers
(Stand Up! Resist!) 
Oh no...




We've run out of patience,
You've run out of time!
This scene will not fall victim
To your violence or lies.

Your "values" are nothing
But excuses to start fights.
Quit fronting like you're standing 
For a moral cause tonight...

United as one, we won't stand aside,
You tried to fuck with our scene... We're gonna fuck your life!

This machine, this machine, this machine... THIS MACHINE, 
KILLS FUCKING FASCISTS!
Dead... That's right, DEAD!

You don't have to be a racist, 
To be a nazi, fuck!
Your mindless nationalism 
Gives you credentials enough.

You spew your right wing rhetoric,
When we got your attention...
You've mistaken the punk scene
For the Republican Convention!

No more infiltration, no more right wing lies,
You don't belong in our scene... We'll fight you till we die!

This machine, this machine, this machine... THIS MACHINE, 
KILLS FUCKING FASCISTS!
Dead... ahhh... DIE!
In a letter to every president, congressman, career politician,
Scrawled in spite across the envelope
With all of our conviction.
In only took a few hours for his peers
To find him guilty in a trial too fair,
A wobblie, immigrant worker has no place among the living.

"My body if I could choose to ashes it reduce."

Murdered by the capitalist,
1915 be careful of what you wish.
Who is wrong and who is righteous?

What was stolen from us we will replace,
Off with the head on the body we feast,
Who is wrong and who is righteous,
Will never be our own decision.

He yelled fire to the squad with guns, they stopped his heart from beating.
Every word he wrote, he spoke, he sung, we are still singing:

"My body if I could choose to ashes it reduce,
And let the breezes blow to where some flowers grow.
Perhaps some fading flower then would come to life and bloom again".

If the workers take a notion,
They can stop all speeding trains,
Every ship upon the ocean.
They can tie with mighty chains
Every wheel in the creation,
Every mine and every mill.
Fleets and armies of all nations
Will at our command stand still.








No justice in a legal system run by criminals,
If you don't like the court ruling then you shouldn't be poor.
Now, go die... 
Go die...
Go die!
One trillion dollars could buy a lot of bling
  One trillion dollars could buy most anything
  One trillion dollars buying bullets, buying guns
  One trillion dollars in the hands of killers, thugs

Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
  Fuck the world, a lot of people gotta die tonight
  Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh 
  Fuck the world, 
  Kill 'em all

One trillion dollars to Africa, Iraq
  One trillion dollars and it’s never coming back
  One trillion dollars could buy some bad-ass drugs
  One trillion dollars makes me wanna kill myself

Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
  Fuck the world, a lot of people gotta die tonight
  Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh 
  Fuck the world, yeah, yeah
  Kill 'em all

Until the sun burns from the sky
  Until the sun burns so bright this world is no more
  Sun burns from the sky...
  And all the people are just dust on the ground

One trillion dollars could buy a heart, a soul
  One trillion dollars buying nations - all the world
  One trillion dollars could make the fat lady sing
  One trillion dollars, what a bullshit useless thing

Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
  Fuck the world, a lot of people gotta die tonight
  Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
  Fuck the world, a lot of people gotta die tonight
  Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
  Shit loads of money spent will show us wrong from right
  Fuck the world
  Kill 'em all


16 year old girl, in a hollow carved out place
  Just looking for some prettiness,
  But the cuts in her arm don't paint for her, a very pretty view
  In her mind... she dreams that she is... far away, from...

The bright lights of America
  Life and death in a sold out-erica,
  To live and die in the heart of America
  Where they sell souls,
  The bright lights of America, 
  Life and death in a sold out-erica,
  To live and die in the heart of America
  Where they sell souls

A concrete city hell - city hell
  Suburbs that never end - just like an ocean
  One parent lives in each of them
  Passed back and forth he huffs glue to escape both bitter homes,
  He's just one... of desperate ranks... who can't break free from...

The bright lights of America
  Life and death in a sold out-erica,
  To live and die in the heart of America
  Where they sell souls,
  The bright lights of America, 
  life and death in a sold out-erica,
  To live and die in the heart of America
  Where they sell souls

I just want you to know there are warehouses full 
  Of fucked up kids like you and me - can't find our way
  So many lost in strife, caught in an endless fight
  To leave this empty ugly place, I'm leaving you as sane!

The bright lights of America
  Life and death in a sold out-erica,
  To live and die in the heart of America
  Where they sell souls,
  The bright lights of America, 
  life and death in a sold out-erica,
  To live and die in the heart of America
  Where they sell souls

The bright lights of America
  Life and death in a sold out-erica,
  To live and die in the heart of America
  Where they sell souls,
  The bright lights of America, 
  life and death in a sold out-erica,
  To live and die in the heart of America
  Where they sell souls








Seems every station on the TV 
  is selling something no one can be 
  If every page was torn from the magazine 
  would cash still drive the media machine? 
  The products, damage and pursuit are endless 
  identity can leave you selfless 

We will not witness this anymore 
  This is the end for you my friend 
  I can't forgive, I won't forget 
  on and on, we sing our songs and 
  on and on, the wars wage on and 
  on and on, we sing our songs for more for more 

Your eyes are open but you can't see 
  your mouth is moving but you don't speak 
  a blitzkrieg of images to break your will 
  I hope you choke on every pill 

We will not witness this anymore 
  This is the end for you my friend 
  I can't forgive, I won't forget 
  on and on, we sing our songs and 
  on and on, the wars wage on and 
  on and on, we sing our songs for more 

We will not witness this anymore

[Chorus:]
Broken bones and broken glass,
Broken hearts and broken heads.
Living the life.

Close my eyes try to make it last.
Outrun the wretched memories of my past.

It moves too fast.
I got no chance.
A freight train racing set to crash.

[Chorus:]
Broken bones and broken glass,
Broken hearts and broken heads.
Living the life.

Wake up wondering: "How did I get here?"
Then cross my heart and say a fucking prayer.
Ecstasy, tears, bravery, fears.

This boat may float, but it don't steer.

[Chorus:]
Broken bones and broken glass,
Broken hearts and broken heads.
Living the life.

Life's long and winding roads leading us
To a never ending trail to keep our youth.

It flashes by in lessons painfully attained.
Blood and sweat, black and blue.
Some surrender I got nothing to surrender to.

[Chorus:]
Broken bones and broken glass,
Broken hearts and broken heads.
Living the life.

So now you're living.

[Chorus:]
Broken bones and broken glass,
Broken hearts and broken heads.
Living the life.

Close my eyes try to make it last.
Outrun the wretched memories of my past.
This is the sound of a dropping bomb

After years are we still all content
With being pawns in war game chess?
Shuffled by King George and his English Queen
On a board of autocracy

As fundamentalist citing stories and fables
Of whose god is more righteously skilled
In whose gods' honor that we are all killed...

A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead!
A dead ringer for Armageddon, yeah
Dead ringer dead!
A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead!
This State Funeral, we do not mourn

And still the wicked sleep
And dream of endless years of tyranny
Passed on by incestuous means
Skull and Bone, Freemason reigns

A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead!
A dead ringer for Armageddon, yeah
Dead ringer dead!
A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead!
This State Funeral, we do not mourn

Destroy all adversary - free yourself
Erase the common enemy - free yourself
Extinguishing the quarry - free yourself
Through the smoke screen we seek out justice...



One billion workers stand up from their chairs,
Their faces no longer struck with their fears.
Attack! Attack! 
Stabbed in the back
Disgraced! Disgraced!
Traitors trade face to face.
Revolution, the engine of history

When all the lights go out
When all the world is in doubt
When all the goods cease to move
I won't be alone
When all the swords become plows
When all the fields are afoul
When all the cogs cease to turn
I won't be alone

Punching the clock, stabbing the boss
We don't need the CEOs; they need us!
Attack! Attack! 
Outsourced for a hack
Disgraced! Disgraced! 
Displace and replace
Proletarians of the world unite
You have nothing to lose but your chains

When all the lights go out
When all the world is in doubt
When all the goods cease to move
I won't be alone
When all the swords become plows
When all the fields are afoul
When all the cogs cease to turn
I won't be alone

We are not numbers, we are names.
We won't be alone!
We are not crime reports, we are history.
We won't be alone!
No, we are not folklore, we are culture.
We won't be alone!
We are not human resources, we are human beings.
I won't be a, I won't be a
We won't be alone!

When all the lights go out, when all the lights go out...

When all the lights go out
When all the world is in doubt
When all the goods cease to move
I won't be alone
When all the swords become plows
When all the fields are afoul
When all the cogs cease to turn
I won't be a, I won't be a
We won't be alone
TURNCOAT! 
KILLER! 
LIAR! 
THIEF!
Criminal with protection of the law!

Go!

States lies dressed up as evening news
We're tired of lies we want the truth!
Brodcast by corpses courting you
We're tired of lies we want the truth!
Most people they will never know
We're tired of lies we want the truth!
With your or against you?
Then I am against you because you're a...

TURNCOAT! KILLER! LIAR! THIEF!
Criminal with protection of the law

TURNCOAT! KILLER! LIAR! THIEF!
Criminal with protection of the law

In your corner makes me wanna
Douse myself in gasoline!
Civil servants fall in line for you
Too brainwashed to see the truth
You use anyone you can!

TURNCOAT! KILLER! LIAR! THIEF!
Criminal with protection of the law

TURNCOAT! KILLER! LIAR! THIEF!
Criminal with protection of the

KILLER!

LIAR!

A TURNCOAT! and a THIEF!

Criminal with protection of the law!
The law!
Criminal with protection of the law.
Who would Jesus bomb? Yeah, who would Jesus kill?
The double talk is past surreal,
The word of god is now the word of hate,
War is peace and freedom is the police state,
Can't you see the writing on the wall?
Democracy lays trampled on the floor...
You better believe that...

[Chorus:]
Hell yeah, I'm confused for sure what 
I thought was the New Millennium is 1984!
Mr. Orwell from the grave, adding fresh ink to the page
As the unpresident declares an endless war...
Welcome to 1984!

Feels like Nazi Germany and Hitler on TV,
As the unpresident spews his homophobic speech,
Didn't the Allies fight a war to end extremist fascist law
So tell me NOW what the fuck are we fighting for?

I just can not take it anymore,
Democracy lays trampled on the floor...
Man, isn't freedom great?!

[Chorus]

Now we've got
Armies of peace, armed to the teeth, 
Delivering death to make the world a better place!
So celebrate the weapons spending, 
Say a toast to Armageddon, raise some hell!
We're all headed straight to hell!

[Chorus]
I've seen a lot of rip-offs in my life. 
Seen a lot of scams. 
A lot of crooks and crooked schemes, crooked sharks. 
Part one of the story reads...
The liquor store thief. 
The stick up man. 
Thrown into the clink, 
never coming back until the day he's grey and old. 

I seen a lot of rip-offs in my life. 
The rip-offs of the old and the young, the weak, the sick, 
The never known. 
Stabbed repeatedly in the back by the Wall Street suit. 
The Washington hack. 
Lining up their pockets with the people's cash and...
Laughing all the way to the bank. 

Do you want to live your life as a slave? 
In chains from the cradle to the grave. 
The economy is suffering, let it die...

I seen a lot of bailouts in my life. 
But where are the bailouts for the homeless and the poor? 
And while we're on the subject 
I could use a few bucks for a guitar amp. 
A new six string, and a tank of gas. 
Everything that I want (That I want!)...

We're so fucked and we don't give a fuck, no. 
We're so fucked, but no we just don't care, no. 
We're so fucked, this world is shit out of luck 
and we don't give a fuck. 

Do you want to live your life as a slave? 
In chains from the cradle to the grave. 
The economy is suffering, let it die...

When the cities burn down we'll all be warm. 
When the cities burn down we'll all keep warm. 
When the cities burn down we'll all be warm.

We're so fucked, we're so fucked
[Chorus:]
Sing a hymn for the dead 
Because in death as in life 
We are one in the same, 
Sing a hymn for the world 
To avert eugenic errors, go! 

The sun sets, the light fades, 
The blood red on an empty street, 
It's not night, it's not day, 
It's no more for an unfortunate soul who 
Witnessed his life violently erased, 
From the horror of the human race 
Bright future's exchanged for profit, 
Living half alive 

[Chorus]

In life now pay respects to your blood 
Those in the vast of the great, 
Unknown, unite there, your heart's one 
In moments you'll never forget, yeah 
History lessons direct from the grave, 
Lost souls of the lost divide, 
Liberate your generation, 
Living, rotting flesh 

[Chorus]

Call out tyranny! 
A spark of dissent 
Can light a fury of flame, 
Call out to be free! 

Sound off! Be the voice of a generation, 
Dissent! You've got a choice to make... 
Sound off! Be the voice of a generation, 
Dissent! You've got a choice to make... 

Strip away! Be the voice of a generation 
Strip away! You've got a choice to make 
Cut away! Cut away! 
Strip away! Strip away! 
Cut away! Strip away your chains! 

[Chorus] (x2)
When all you need was a little motivation
They pointed fingers and yelled dead generation
When all you need was a little care
All you got was an old white hair blank stare
Have you ever needed an ounce of love
And all you got was a whole lot of fucked

Say your prayers
It's the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation

Condescending broad generalizations
Get real old real fast
Just because most hippies and their parents have sold out
Does not mean that you, your children and their kids won't last...

Say your prayers
It's the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation

Say your prayers
It's the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation

Aggressiveness is godliness
Combativeness is holiness
Destructiveness is faithfulness
Deadliness is devoutness
Praying to a god that they created
And know damn well does not exist...
We find them on their knees



Like a ghost,
Emptiness haunted his years,
Still his heart was made of nothing less than good. 
Insecure narrative in his head 
Something less than schizophrenia, 
Creeping him with every move that he makes
 Breath he takes, 
A pitiful walk alone 
To his empty home, 
Where he'll lay and he'll sleep by himself.

Go west, young man.
Your future is untold.
You can find your dreams on the California coast. 
Go west young man. 
Your future 
isn't too far away.
Go!

She hates me, 
And I know it because she said so.
And I forgot my number 
And my socialist manifesto. 
Will it be a tragedy, 
Or a comedy?
The choice is up to you. 
Life can lead you along on a leash.
Or you can break free 
And run on your own.
Don't waste your life, 
Go and live your life, 
Like it's your last day here on this earth

Go west, young man.
Your future is untold.
You can find your dreams on the California coast. 
Go west young man. 
Your future isn't too 
Far away, 
Far away!

Don't waste your life,
Go and live your life,
Like it's your last day here on this earth.

Go west young man. 
Your future is untold. 
You can find your dreams on the California coast. 
Go west young man.
Your future isn't too
 Far away,
Far away!

Go west young man.
Your future is untold. 
You can find your dreams on the California coast. 
Go west!
We gotta work to make the facts fit the false charges
  Pull the wool over the eyes of the filthy masses
  Stab the people in the back for the corporate choice
  Roll the propaganda out using The People's Voice

We don't want to talk about it...

The press scribble scribble every half-truth spoke
  Then shoot it round the country like an April Fools joke
  Hype the nation for a Desert Storm love affair
  Wave the stars and stripes like you just don't care!

They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night
  They talk until their face turns blue - Red white and blue!
  But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
  We find the picture still askew

They don't want to... talk talk talk talk talk about it
  They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
  Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
  They don't want to talk about it
  They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
  Wave the flag and cowardly salute

And on the TV screen...
  ..Diversion and aversion is the flavor of the day
  Was it WMDs? Or Democracy?
  Blame it on MI-6 or the CIA
  The White House Press Corpse only has one thing to say...

"We don't want to talk about it!"

The White House boils over, "Al Jazeera got it wrong!"
  The Press Corpse jumps onboard singing the White House song
  While over in Iraq thousands are dead because of lies
  The spineless war drumming press corpse have taken lives

They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night
  They talk until their face turns blue - Red white and blue!
  But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
  We find the picture still askew

They don't want to... talk talk talk talk talk about it
  They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
  Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
  They don't want to talk about it
  They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
  Wave the flag and cowardly salute

Fires fueled on endless lies
  Black shrouds coat desert skies
  A nation's viewpoint blurred and led
  As embeds report what they're fed

We don't want to talk about it... (4x)

(We don't want to talk about it...) 
  We don't, don't want to, we don't wanna talk about it
  (We don't want to...) 
  We don't, don't want to, we don't wanna talk

They don't want to... talk talk talk talk talk about it
  They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
  Wave the flag and cowardly salute
  They don't want to talk about it
  They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
  Wave the flag and cowardly salute






You can spoon my eyes out, 
But I can still see through you. 
Slice my ears from my head, 
but you can't shut out the sounds of truth. 
Lock off each hand at the wrist 
So I can't raise my fist! 

You can kill the protester (can't kill) 
You can't kill the protest 
You can murder the rebel (murder) 
You can't murder the rebellion 

Sawed my feet at the ankles 
But I wasn't going to run (I wasn't going to run) 
So you grabbed my face 
And sliced off my tongue 
Lock off each hand at the wrist, 
So I can't raise my fist! 

You can kill the protester (can't kill) 
You can't kill the protest 
You can murder the rebel (murder) 
You can't murder the rebellion 

Lying still now, no way to speak. 
There's nothing to fear (there's nothing to fear) 
Lying still now, no way to speak. 
There's nothing to fear 
No nothing to fear 
Because bullets can't silence ideas! 

You can kill the protester (can't kill) 
You can't kill the protest 
You can murder the rebel (murder) 
You can't murder the rebellion 

The rebellion 
The rebellion 
No! 


It's a gut check of what you believe!

A Global Pax Americana
Neo-con, neo-fascist blueprint - USA hegemony
Charlatan war hawks, untried, untrue
Celebrate and exploit tragedy
To steal away control

And it's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a New American Century?
Endless...
Endless violence, endless hatred
Endless empire tyranny
Will you make a stand for human dignity?
Or never ending hate?

It's a think tank, psycho and crazed
War profiteering membership - a world catastrophe
They've got a war plan that counts on you
To kill for their corporate empire 
While they sit at home

And it's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a New American Century?
Endless...
Endless violence, endless hatred
Endless empire tyranny
Will you make a stand for human dignity?

Are you going to...Fight Back!?
Time to prove what you really believe
We gotta FIGHT BACK(!)
Until we win it all
We gotta FIGHT BACK! 
Will you heed the call?
The Neo-Fascist race to war
The PNAC plan to rule the world

It's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a New American Century?

Are you going to...

And it's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a New American Century?
Endless...
Endless violence, endless hatred
Endless empire tyranny
Will you make a stand for human dignity?

Will you? Or never ending hate?





Your invasion was a crime
Your righteous explanations - lies
Kicking in our doors, raids at night
Won't win you hearts, you've lost your minds.
Your killing of my family
Did not make a fan out of me
If this is what your freedom reaps
Keep it for your United States. 
I'd tell you all these things but I can't speak because...

I'm dead, I'm dead
my life is life no more
I'm dead, I'm dead
your bullets cut into my flesh

I love to read, write poetry
I love my friends, my family
I love the sand and love the sea
The water splashing over me
Now I will haunt you in your dreams
Never another restful sleep
I'll forever be by your side. 
In life you're victim, death your bride.
My memory will haunt you when you're awake or asleep because...

I'm dead, I'm dead
my life is life no more
I'm dead, I'm dead
your bullets cut into my flesh
Your cluster bombs ripped me to shreds


I'd Tell You But... 

Your invasion was a crime
Your righteous explanations - lies

I'd tell you all these things but I can't speak because...

LOOK BACK on history, nothing much has changed
THOUSANDS of soldiers of all countries, all marching the same
Every nation's leader says that our side is right
Every nation's leader says the time has come to fight
But they use the common people to settle their scores
IT'S TIME THAT WE REFUSE TO FIGHT IN ANY OF THEIR WARS!

We're looking to start a new army, 
Too smart to fight, too smart to die
We're looking to start a new army,  
Too smart to fight, too smart to kill 
For you
For you!

One two three four, one two three four
One two three four, one two three four
One two three four, one two three four
One two three four, four

JOIN NOW the ranks of all nations who refuse to go to war
REFUSE to pull the trigger of a gun for leaders 'round the world
I'd rather fight to spread some tolerance & unity
Than buy into their nationalistic brainwashing
Killing mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, common human beings
Not savages but people, like you, like me!

We're looking to start a new army, 
Too smart to fight, too smart to die
We're looking to start a new army,
Too smart to fight, too smart to kill 

We're looking to start a new army,
Too smart to fight, too smart to die
We're looking to start a new army,
Too smart to fight, too smart to kill 
For you!

We're looking for a few good men
We're looking for a few good women
Who are not afraid to fight against tyranny
But who refuse to fight....with tyranny...tyranny
(Refuse!) [16x]

We're looking to start a new army, 
Too smart to fight, too smart to die
We're looking to start a new army, 
Too smart to fight, too smart to kill

We're looking to start a new army,  
Too smart to fight, too smart to die
We're looking to start a new army, 
Too smart to fight, too smart to kill
FOR YOU!
FOR YOU!
I woke up sweat soaked in the morning, 
I was mourning freedom buried deep, 
Mourning freedom buried deep 
In tickets and broadcasts through power lines 
Freedom buried in sound bites, buried in headlines 

And we sing 
Woah oh Woah oh 

A nation in fervor has given up 
No, no, no, this fight has just began 
With movements and revolutions as few and far between 
As movements and revolutions will ever come to be 

This scare is blood soaked red – soaked red 
Marked down the last words that you said
As we watched this city 

Woah oh Woah oh 
Watch it burn 
Woah oh Woah oh 
Alright! 

It's beaten in and beaten in 
We're coming back around again 
It's beaten in and beaten in 
We're coming back around again 

This scare is blood soaked red – soaked red 
Marked down the last words that you said
As we watched this city

Fall and hit the ground, 
No one can ever replace what we've lost now, 
Fall and hit the ground 
No one can ever replace what we've lost now, yeah! 

We're coming back around 
Woah oh Woah oh 
[x8]
Down in some lone valley
In a sad lonesome place
Where the wild birds do all
Their notes to increase

Farewell pretty Saro
I bid you Adieu
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go

Well my love she won't have me
So I understand
She wants a freeholder
Who owns a house and land

I cannot maintain her
With silver and gold
And all of the fine things
That a big house can hold

If I was a poet
And could write a fine hand
I'd write my love a letter
That she'd understand

And write it by the river
Where the waters overflow
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go


* - Кавер на английскую народную балладу XVIII века
The man in me will do nearly any task,
And as for compensation, there's little he would ask.
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.

Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
I think to myself I might not take it any more.
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me.

But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near,
Sets my a heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears.

The man in me will hide sometimes
To keep from bein' seen,
But that's just because he doesn't want
To turn into some machine.
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.
Oh, the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathing
Like the stillness in the wind
'Fore the hurricane begins
The hours when the ship comes in.

And the seas will split,
And the ship will hit,
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound,
And the wind will pound,
And the morning will be breaking.

Oh, the fishes will laugh,
As they swim out of the path,
And the seagulls they'll be smiling,
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in.

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken,
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean.

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts,
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in.

Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touching,
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watching.

Oh, the foes will rise
With the sleep in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in.

Then they'll raise their hands
Saying, “We'll meet all your demands
But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered.”
And like Pharaoh's tribe
They'll be drownded in the tide,
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered.
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day
It's too hot to sleep, time is running away
Feel like my soul has turned into steel
I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal
There's not even room enough to be anywhere
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing what was in her mind
I just don't see why I should even care
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paree
I've followed the river and I got to the sea
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes
Sometimes my burden seems more than I can bear
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

I was born here and I'll die here against my will
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there



[Verse 1:]
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-going to fall  

[Verse 2:]
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-going to fall  

[Verse 3:]
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warning
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
Heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-going to fall  

[Verse 4:]
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall  

[Verse 5:]
Oh, what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what will you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I'll know my song well before I start singing
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall
I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky,
When the children were babies and played on the beach.
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
You were always so close and still within reach.

Sara, sara,
Whatever made you want to change your mind? 
Sara, sara,
So easy to look at, so hard to define.

I can still see them playin with their pails in the sand,
They run to the water their buckets to fill.
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands,
As they follow each other back up the hill.

Sara, sara,
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Sara, sara,
Radiant jewel, a mystical wife.

Sleepin in the woods by a fire in the night,
Drinkin white rum in a portugal bar,
Them playin leapfrog and hearin about snow white,
You in the marketplace in savanna-la-mar.

Sara, sara,
Its all so clear, I could never forget,
Sara, sara,
Lovin you is the one thing Ill never regret.

I can still hear the sounds of those methodist bells,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Stayin up four days in the chelsea hotel,
Writin "sad-eyed lady of the lowlands" for you.

Sara, sara,
Wherever we travel were never apart.
Sara, oh sara,
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart.

How did I meet you? I dont know.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
You were there in the winter moonlight on the snow
And on lily pond lane when the weather was warm.

Sara, oh sara,
Scorpio, sphinx in a calico dress,
Sara, sara,
You must forgive me my unworthiness.

Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore.
You always responded when I needed your help,
You gimme a map and a key to your door.

Sara, oh sara,
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Sara, oh sara,
Don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
One by one, they followed the sun,
One by one, until there were none.
Two by two, to their lovers they flew,
Two by two, into the foggy dew.
Three by three, they danced on the sea,
Four by four, they danced on the shore,
Five by five, they tried to survive,
Six by six, they were playing with tricks.

How many paths did they try and fail?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
How much poison did they inhale?
How many black cats crossed their trail?

Seven by seven, they headed for heaven,
Eight by eight, they got to the gate,
Nine by nine, they drank the wine,
Ten by ten, they drank again.

How many tomorrow's have are they given away?
How many compared to yesterday?
How many more without any reward?
How many more can they afford?

Two by two, they stepped into the ark,
Two by two, they step in the dark.
Three by three, they're turning the key,
Four by four, they turn it some more,
One by one, they follow the sun,
Two by two, to another rendezvous.
You go to my head 
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head 
Like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought 
That you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head 
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say "I love you"
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there.
She once was a true love of mine.

Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm,
To keep her from the howlin' winds.

Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
That's the way I remember her best.

I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all.
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night,
In the brightness of my day.

So if you're travelin' in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there.
She once was a true love of mine.



How many roads must a man walk down,

Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin fallin' down

You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don't know how to smile

Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If there's anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?

You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell yuh
That you ain't a-got no friend

Your babies are crying louder
It's pounding on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
It's pounding on your brain
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
Like the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass it is turning black
There's no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
There's no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born
You walk into the room 
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you'll say
When you get home.

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You raise up your head
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
"It's his"
And you says, "What's mine?"
And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God
Am I here all alone?" 

But something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, "How does it feel
To be such a freak?"
And you say, "Impossible"
As he hands you a bone.

And something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations.
You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known.

But something is happening here
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, "Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan".

And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word "NOW"
And you say, "For what reason?"
And he says, "How?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back, "You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home".

Because something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones.

Does something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Oh sister when I come to lie in your arms
You should not treat me like a stranger
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger.

Oh sister am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth
To love and follow His direction?

We grew up together 
From the cradle to the grave
We died and were reborn
And then mysteriously saved.

Oh sister when I come to knock on your door
Don't turn away you'll create sorrow
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow.



Down the street the dogs are barkin'
And the day is a-gettin' dark
As the night comes in a-fallin'
The dogs'll lose their bark
An' the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
For I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes they start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
An' I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I'm one too many mornings
An' a thousand miles behind

It's a restless hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good
When ev'rything I'm a-sayin'
You can say it just as good.
You're right from your side
I'm right from mine
We're both just one too many mornings
An' a thousand miles behind
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
His voice was low with pain,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
If I ride back again.
But if you ride back and I am left,
You'll do as much for me,
Mother, you know, must hear the news
So write to her tenderly."

"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Her fond face pale with woe,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
I'll see her soon, I know."
Just then the order came to charge,
For an instant hand touched hand,
They said "aye" and away they rode,
That brave and devoted band.

Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
The rebels, they shot and shelled,
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And guarded them as they fell.
There soon came a horrible dying yell
From heights that they could not gain,
And those whom doom and death had spared
Rode slowly back again.

But among the dead that were left on the hill
Was the boy with the curly hair,
The tall dark man, who rode by his side,
Lay dead beside him there.
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
The words that her lover had said,
Momma, you know, awaits the news,
And she'll only know he's dead.
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening, 
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight.
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man, 
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, 
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

"There must be some way out of here," - said the Joker to the Thief,
  "There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
  Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
  None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."

"No reason to get excited," - the thief, he kindly spoke,
  "There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
  But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,
  So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."

All along the watchtower, princess kept the view,
  While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
  Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
  Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.















All Along the Watchtower

"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."

"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."

All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.

Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.



A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers' blood,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
A handle hid out in the dark,
A hand set the spark,
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man's brain,
But he can't be blamed,
He's only a pawn in their game.

A South politician preaches to the poor white man,
 "You got more than blacks, don't complain!
You're better than them, you been born with white skin!" they explain,
And the Negro's name
Is used, it is plain
For the politician's gain,
As he rises to fame,
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train,
But it ain't him to blame,
He's only a pawn in their game.

The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
And the marshals and cops get the same,
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool,
He's taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin,
To keep up his hate,
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he's in,
But it ain't him to blame,
He's only a pawn in their game.

From the poverty shacks he looks from the cracks to the tracks,
And the hoof beats pound in his brain,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Shoot in the back
With his fist in a clinch,
To hang and to lynch,
To hide 'neath the hood,
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain,
He ain't got no name,
But it ain't him to blame,
He's only a pawn in their game.

Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught,
They lowered him down as a king,
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun,
He'll see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain:
‘Only a pawn in their game'.




I'm out here a thousand miles from my home
Walking a road other men have gone down
I'm seeing a new world of people and things
Hear paupers and peasants and princes and kings.

Hey hey Woody Guthrie I wrote you a song
About a funny old world that's coming along
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.

Hey Woody Guthrie but I know that you know
All the things that I'm saying and a many times more
I'm singing you the song but I can't you sing enough
Cause there's not many men that've done the things that you've done.

Here's to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too
And to all the good people that travelled with you
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.

I'm leaving tomorrow but I could leave today
Somewhere down the road someday
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Is to say I've been hitting some hard travelling too.




Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
I'm sailing away in the morning,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I'll be landing?

No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
There's nothing I wish to be owning,
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean.

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden,
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona?

Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning.

That I might be gone a long time
And it's only that I'm asking
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passing?

Oh, how can, how can you ask me again?
It only brings me sorrow,
The same thing I want from you today
I would want again tomorrow.

I got a letter on a lonesome day,
It was from her ship a-sailing,
Saying, ‘I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
It depends on how I'm a-feeling.'

Well, if you, my love, must think thataway,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you're going.

So take heed, take heed of the western wind,
Take heed of the stormy weather,
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me –
Spanish boots of Spanish leather.
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Ev'rybody's got their hats bowed down,
The sun don't shine above the ground,
Ain't a-going down to Oxford Town.

He went down to Oxford Town,
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown,
Better get away from Oxford Town.

Oxford Town around the bend,
He comes to the door, he couln't get in,
All because of the color of his skin,
What do you think about that, my frien' ?

Me and my gal, my gal's son,
We got met with a tear gas bomb,
I don't even know why we come,
Going back where we come from.

Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Ev'rybody singing a sorrowful tune,
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon,
Somebody better investigate soon..
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea,
Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.

Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun,
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.

You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give,
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole,
Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul.

You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest, they'd kill me if I lie,
I'd sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die.

The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.

It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge,
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend,
And if there is eternity I'd love you there again.

Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.

You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Just bein' next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
'cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Pistols shots ring out in the barroom night
  Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
  She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
  Cries out "My God they killed them all"
  Here comes the story of the Hurricane
  The man the authorities came to blame
  For something that he never done
  Put him in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
  The champion of the world.

Three bodies lying there does Patty see
  And another man named Bello moving around mysteriously
  "I didn't do it" he says and he throws up his hands
  "I was only robbing the register I hope you understand
  I saw them leaving" he says and he stops
  "One of us had better call up the cops"
  And so Patty calls the cops
  And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing
  In the hot New Jersey night.

Meanwhile far away in another part of town
  Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
  Number one contender for the middleweight crown
  Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
  When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
  Just like the time before and the time before that
  In Patterson that's just the way things go
  If you're black you might as well not SHOW up on the street
  'Less you wanna draw the heat.

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the corps
  Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
  He said "I saw two men running out 
  They looked like middleweights
  They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates"
  And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
  Cop said "Wait a minute boys this one's not dead"
  So they took him to the infirmary
  And though this man could hardly see
  They told him that he could identify the guilty men.

Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
  Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
  The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
  Says "Wha'd you bring him in here for ? He ain't the guy !"
  Yes here comes the story of the Hurricane
  The man the authorities came to blame
  For something that he never done
  Put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
  The champion of the world.

Four months later the ghettos are in flame
  Rubin's in South America fighting for his name
  While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
  And the cops are putting the screws to him 
  Looking for somebody to blame
  "Remember that murder that happened in a bar ?"
  "Remember you said you saw the getaway car?"
  "You think you'd like to play ball with the law ?"
  "Think it might-a been that fighter you saw running that night ?"
  "Don't forget that you are white".

Arthur Dexter Bradley said "I'm really not sure"
  Cops said "A boy like you 
  Could use a break
  We got you for the motel job 
  And we're talking to your friend Bello
  Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail 
  Be a nice fellow
  You'll be doing society a favor
  That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver
  We want to put his ass in stir
  We want to pin this triple murder on him
  He ain't no Gentleman Jim".

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
  But he never did like to talk about it all that much
  It's my work he'd say and I do it for pay
  And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
  Up to some paradise
  Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
  And ride a horse along a trail
  But then they took him to the jailhouse
  Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
  The trial was a pig-circus he never had a chance
  The judge made Rubin's witnesses 
  Drunkards from the slums
  To the white folks who watched 
  He was a revolutionary bum
  And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
  No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
  And though they could not produce the gun
  The DA said he was the one who did the deed
  And the all-white jury agreed.

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
  The crime was murder 'one' guess who testified
  Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
  And the newspapers they all went along for the ride
  How can the life of such a man
  Be in the palm of some fool's hand? 
  To see him obviously framed
  Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land 
  Where justice is a game.

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
  Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
  While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
  An innocent man in a living hell
  That's the story of the Hurricane
  But it won't be over till they clear his name
  And give him back the time he's done
  Put him in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
  The champion of the world.







A worried man with a worried mind,
No one in front of me and nothing behind.
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes.
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train

Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.

[Chorus:]
People are crazy and times are strange,
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range.
I used to care, but things have changed.

This place ain't doing me any good.
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag.
Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove.

Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too,
Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through.

[Chorus:]
People are crazy and times are strange,
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range.
I used to care, but things have changed.

I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
If the Bible is right, the world will explode,
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Some things are too hot to touch,
The human mind can only stand so much,
You can't win with a losing hand.

Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street.

[Chorus:]
People are crazy and times are strange,
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range.
I used to care, but things have changed.

I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
You can hurt someone and not even know it.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity,
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high.
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
I'm in love with a woman who don't even appeal to me.

Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.

[Chorus:]
People are crazy and times are strange,
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range.
I used to care, but things have changed.

Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
It makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do

Have you ever felt a gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again

Imagination is silly
You go around willy nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

Oh, my name it is nothing,
My age, it means less,
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest,
I's taught and brought up there
The laws to abide,
And the land that I live in
Has God on its side.

Oh, the history books tell it,
They tell it so well:
The cavalries charged,
The Indians fell,
The cavalries charged,
The Indians died,
Oh, the country was young
With God on its side.

The Spanish-American
War had its day,
And the Civil War, too
Was soon laid away,
And the names of the heroes
I's made to memorize
With guns on their hands
And God on their side.

The First World War, boys,
It came and it went,
The reason for fighting
I never did get,
But I learned to accept it,
Accept it with pride,
For you don't count the dead
When God's on your side.

When the Second World War
Came to an end,
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends,
Though they murdered six million,
In the ovens they fried,
The Germans now too
Have God on their side.

I've learned to hate Russians
All through my whole life,
If another war comes,
It's them we must fight,
To hate them and fear them,
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side.

But now we got weapons
Of the chemical dust,
If fire them we're forced to,
Then fire them we must,
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide,
And you never ask questions
When God's on your side.

In a many dark hour
I've been thinking about this,
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss,
But I can't think for you,
You'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side?

So now as I'm leaving,
I'm weary as hell,
The confusion I'm feeling
Ain't no tongue can tell,
The words fill my head
And fall to the floor,
If God's on our side,
He'll stop the next war.
Come gather 'round, friends,
And I'll tell you a tale
Of when the red iron pits ran empty,
But the cardboard filled windows
And old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.

In the north end of town
My own children are grown,
But I was raised on the other
In the wee hours of youth,
My mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother..

The iron ore poured
As the years passed the door,
The drag lines an' the shovels they was a-humming
'Til one day my brother
Failed to come home,
The same as my father before him.

Well, a long winter's wait,
From the window I watched
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder,
And my schooling was cut
As I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner.

Oh, the years passed again,
And the giving was good
With the lunch bucket filled every season,
What with three babies born
The work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason,
Then the shaft was soon shut,
And more work was cut
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen,
'Til a man come to speak,
And he said in one week
That number eleven was closing.

They complained in the East
They are playing too high,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
That it's much cheaper down
In the South American towns,
Where the miners work almost for nothing.

So the mining gates locked,
And the red iron rotted,
And the room smelted heavy from drinking,
Where the sad silent song
Made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.

I lived by the window
As he talked to himself,
This silence of tongues it was building,
Then one morning's wake,
The bed, it was bare,
And I's left alone with three children..

The summer is gone,
The ground's turning cold,
The stores, one by one they're a-folding,
My children will go
As soon they grow,
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
I pity the poor immigrant 
Who wishes he would've stayed home
Who uses all his power to do evil
But in the end is always left so alone.
That man who with his fingers cheats,
And who lies with every breath
Who passionately hates his life,
And likewise fears his death.

I pity the poor immigrant,
Who's strength is spend in vain,
Who's heaven is like ironsides,
Who's tears are like rain.
Who eats but is not satisfied,
Who hears but does not see.
Who falls in love with wealth itself,
And turns his back on me.

I pity the poor immigrant,
Who tramples through the mud
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood.
Who's visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass,
I pity the poor immigrant
When his gladness comes to pass.
William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin',
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station,
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder,
But you, who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears.

William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
With rich wealthy parents, who provide and protect him,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling,
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking,
But you, who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears.

Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage,
And never sat once at the head of the table,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger,
And you, who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears.

In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level,
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded,
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em,
And that ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Who just happened to be feeling that way witout warning,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance,
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence,
Oh, but you, who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now's the time for your tears.



Песня основа на реальных событиях: 9 февраля 1963 года в отеле "Эмерсон" в Балтиморе на Балу Старых Дев, пьяный двадцатичетырёхлетний Уильям Деверо Занцингер ударил игрушечной тростью пятидесятиоднолетнюю барменшу Хэтти Кэрролл за то, что она, не принесла ему немедленно заказанный бурбон. Через некоторое время Кэрролл, президент местного общества чернокожих, почувствовала себя плохо и была доставлена в больницу, где и скончалась через несколько часов от кровоизлияния в мозг. 28 августа того же года за убийство и нападение Занцингер был приговорён к шести месяцам тюрьмы.
Some time ago a crazy dream came to me,
I dreamt I was walkin' into World War Three,
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kinda words he could say.
He said, “It was a bad dream,
I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though
They're dreams and they're only in your head”.

I said, "Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain".
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane".
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said, "Tell me about it".

Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast,
It was all over by quarter past,
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on.

Well, I got up and walked around
And up and down the lonesome town,
I stood a-wondering which way to go,
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
And walked on down the road,
It was a normal day.

Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And leaned my head and I gave a yell,
"Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man!"
A shotgun fired and away I ran,
I don't blame them too much, though
They didn't know me.

Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
I seen a man, I said, "Howdy, friend,
I guess there's just us two!"
He screamed a bit and away he flew,
Thought I was a Communist.

Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave,
"Let's go and play Adam and Eve."
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'
When she said, "Hey, man, you crazy or sumthin'?
You see what happened last time they started".
Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown,
And there was nobody aroun',
I got into the driver's seat
And I drove down to 42nd Street
In my Cadillac,
Good car to drive after a war.

Well, I remember seein' some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad,
But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill
So the radio didn't work so well.
Turned on my record player,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singin'
"Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa
Our Loves Are Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah!"
 .
I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue,
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
"When you hear the beep
It will be three o'clock",
She said that for over an hour
And I hung up.

Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Sayin', "Hey I've been havin' the same old dreams,
But mine was a little different, you see,
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me,
I didn't see you around".

Well, now time passed, and now it seems
Everybody's having them dreams,
Everybody sees themselves walkin' around with no one else.
Half of the people can be part right all of the time,
Some of the people can be all right part of the time,
But all of the people can't be all right all of the time.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
"I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours",
 I said that.
Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It's something you did
God knows when
But you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the pig pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten

Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early may
Orders from the D.A. 
Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't try No Doz
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weatherman
To know which way the wind blows 	

Get sick, get well
Hang around an ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write Braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail
Look out kid 
You're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters
Six-time users
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders 
Watch the parkin' meters

Ah get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success 
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid 
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole 
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't wanna be a bum
You better chew gum 
The pump don't work
‘Cause the vandals took the handles
How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, 
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, 
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?
Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
Sooner or later you make a mistake
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood, but not my own

Night after night, day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb
I'm circling around the Southern Zone
I pay in blood, but not my own

Low cards are what I've got
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad
I've been out and around with the rowdy men
Just like you, my handsome friend
My head's so hard, must be made of stone
I pay in blood, but not my own

Another politician pumping out the piss
Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
You got the same eyes that your mother does
If only you could prove who your father was
Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine
You gulped it down and you cross the line
Man can't live by bread alone
I pay in blood, but not my own

How I made it back home, nobody knows
Or how I survived so many blows
I've been through hell, what good did it do?
You bastard! I'm suppose to respect you?
I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse
Show me your moral virtues first
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own

You pet your lover in the bed
Come here, I'll break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury, not to praise
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
I pay in blood, but not my own
Damn you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks.
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks.

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly.

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain.

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion'
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud.

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins.

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do.

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness?
Do you think that it could?
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul.

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon!
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed.
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead.
Come gather 'round people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come senators, congressmen please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside and it is ragin'.
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'.
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'.

The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'.
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'.


The Times They Are A-Changing

Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown

And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you
Is worth savin'

Then you better start swimmin'
Or youl'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again

And don't speak too soon
For the wheel still in spin
And there's no telling who
That it's namin'

For the loser now
Will be later the win
For the times, they are a-changing'

Come senators, congressmen 
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall

For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
The battle outside
Ragging 

Will soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand

Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly agin'

Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changing

The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one
Will later be fast

And the present now
Will soon be the past
The order is
Rapidly fadin'

And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changing


You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies, are all going home
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, baby blue





What good am I if I'm like all the rest
If I just turn away, when I see how you're dressed
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry
What good am I?

What good am I if I know and don't do
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky
What good am I?

What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try
What good am I?

What good am I then to others and me
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?

What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
What good am I?
You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that's winning

You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt
Why then don't you show it

You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You're in with

Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, "How are you?" "Good luck"
But you don't mean it

When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once
And scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I'd rob them

And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is
To see you
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed 
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed 
Whatever colors you have in your mind 
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine. 

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed 
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile 
Until the break of day, let me see 
You make him smile 
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean 
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen. 

Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile 
Why wait any longer for the world to begin 
You can have your cake and eat it too 
Why wait any longer for the one you love 
When he's standing in front of you. 

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed 
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead 
I long to see you in the morning light 
I long to reach for you in the night



If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier 
She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear 
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow 
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so 

We had a falling-out, like lovers often will 
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill 
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart 
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart 

If you get close to her, kiss her once for me 
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free 
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way 
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay 

I see a lot of people as I make the rounds 
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town 
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off 
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft 

Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past 
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast 
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find 
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, “Beware doll, you're bound to fall”
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him do you want to make a deal?

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
But you'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?


Go 'way from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you an' defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me babe 
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I will only let your down
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you an' more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

Go melt back into the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
An' anyway I'm not alone
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
An' to come each time you call
A lover for you life an' nothing more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago.

He saw an animal that liked to growl
Big furry paws and he liked to howl
Great big furry back and furry hair
Ah, think I'll call it a bear.

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago.

He saw an animal up on a hill
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled
He saw milk coming out but he didn't know how
Ah, think I'll call it a cow.

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago.

He saw an animal that liked to snort
Horns on his head and they weren't too short
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull
Ah, I'll think I'll call it a bull.

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago.

He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail
Real dirty face and a curly trail
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big
Ah, think I'll call it a pig.

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago.

Next animal that he did meet
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
Ah, think I'll call it a sheep.

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago.

He saw an animal as smooth as glass
Slithering his way through the grass
Saw him dissappear by a tree near a lake...
They're
  Selling postcards
  Of the hanging
  They're painting
  The passports brown
  The beauty parlor
  Is filled with sailors
  The circus is in town
  Here comes
  The blind commissioner
  They've got him in a trance
  One hand is tied
  To the tight-rope walker
  The other is in his pants
  And the riot squad
  They're restless
  They need somewhere to go
  As Lady
  And I look out tonight
  From Desolation Row

Cinderella
  She seems so easy
  It takes one to know one
  She smiles
  And puts her hands
  In her back pockets
  Bette Davis style
  And in comes Romeo
  He's moaning
  You belong to me I believe
  And someone says
  You're in the wrong place
  My friend
  You better leave
  And the only sound that's left
  After the ambulances go
  Is Cinderella sweeping up
  On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
  The stars are beginning to hide
  The fortunetelling lady
  Has even taken
  All her things inside
  All except for Cain and Abel
  And the hunchback of Notre Dame
  Everybody is making love
  Or else expecting rain
  And the Good Samaritan
  He's dressing
  He's getting ready
  For the show
  He's going
  To the carnival tonight
  On Desolation Row

Now Ophelia
  She's 'neath the window
  For her I feel so afraid
  On her twenty-second birthday
  She already is an old maid

To her death
  Is quite romantic
  She wears an iron vest
  Her profession's her religion
  Her sin is her lifelessness
  And though her eyes
  Are fixed upon
  Noah's great rainbow
  She spends her time peeking
  Into Desolation Row

Einstein
  Disguised as Robin Hood
  With his memories in a trunk
  Passed this way an hour ago
  With his friend
  A jealous monk
  He looked
  So immaculately frightful
  As he bummed a cigarette
  Then he went off
  Sniffing drainpipes
  And reciting the alphabet
  Now you
  Would not think
  To look at him
  But he was famous long ago
  For playing
  The electric violin
  On Desolation Row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
  Inside of a leather cup
  But all his sexless patients
  They're trying to blow it up
  Now his nurse, some local loser
  She's in charge
  Of the cyanide hole
  And she also keeps
  The cards that read
  Have Mercy on His Soul
  They all play
  On penny whistles
  You can hear them blow
  If you lean
  Your head out far enough
  From Desolation Row

Across the street
  They've nailed the curtains
  They're getting ready
  For the feast
  The Phantom of the Opera
  A perfect image of a priest
  They're spoonfeeding Casanova
  To get him to feel more assured
  Then they'll kill him
  With self-confidence
  After poisoning him with words

And the Phantom's
  Shouting to skinny girls
  Get outa here
  If you don't know
  Casanova is just being
  Punished for going
  To Desolation Row

Now at midnight all the agents
  And the superhuman crew
  Come out and round up everyone
  That knows more than they do
  Then they bring them to the factory
  Where the heart-attack machine
  Is strapped across their shoulders
  And then the kerosene
  Is brought down from the castles
  By insurance men who go
  Check to see
  That nobody is escaping
  To Desolation Row

Praise be to Nero's Neptune
  The Titanic sails at dawn
  And everybody's shouting
  Which Side Are You On?
  And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
  Fighting in the captain's tower
  While calypso singers laugh at them
  And fishermen hold flowers
  Between the windows of the sea
  Where lovely mermaids flow
  And nobody has to think too much
  About Desolation Row

Yes
  I received your letter yesterday
  (About the time the door knob broke)
  When you asked how I was doing
  Was that some kind of joke?
  All these people that you mention
  Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
  I had to rearrange their faces
  And give them all another name
  Right now I can't read too good
  Don't send me no more letters no
  Not unless you mail them
  From Desolation Row


* существует кавер на композиции Desolation Row в исполнении группы   My Chemical Romance









When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do 
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love

To make you feel my love



Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
Dust on my face and my cape,
Me and Magdalena on the run
I think this time we shall escape.

Sold my guitar to the baker's son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
But I can get another one
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone.
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.

Was it me that shot him down in the cantina
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
And watch the young torero stand alone.
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When they rode with Villa into Torreon.

Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the little church this side of town.
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.

The way is long but the end is near
Already the fiesta has begun.
The face of God will appear
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

Was that the thunder that I heard?
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain
Come sit by me, don't say a word
Oh, can it be that I am slain?

Quick, Magdalena, take my gun
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Aim well my little one
We may not make it through the night.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by, I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still

Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
Then I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart

There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the risin' sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me
Oh god, I'm one.

My mother was a tailor
She sowed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, lord
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

He fills his glasses up to the brim
And he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is ramblin' from town to town

Oh tell my baby sister,
Not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans,
They call the rising sun

Well, now one foot on the platform
And the other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

I'm goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm goin' back to end my life
Down in the risin' sun

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the risin' sun
It's been the ruin of many poor girl and me
And god, I know, I'm one.



* американская народная песня 
Crickets are chirpin', the water is high
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hangin' dry
The windows wide open, African trees
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note
She'd gone with the man in the long black coat

Somebody seen him hangin' around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote
There was dust on the man in the long black coat

Preacher was a-talkin', there's a sermon he gave
He said, "Every mans conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When it's you who must keep it satisfied"
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat
She gave her heart to the man in the long black coat

There are no mistakes in life, some people say
And it's true sometimes, you can see it that way
But people don't live or die, people just float
She went with the man in the long black coat

There's smoke on the water, it's been there since June
Tree trunks uprooted beneath the high crescent moon
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumblin' force
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse 

She never said nothin', there was nothin' she wrote
She'd gone with the man in the long black coat






There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over its face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day
I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day

Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer was he than I
The moon went down stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day

Don't want to have you hanging
Around me like a leech
I think your just a problem
So stay the hell away from me
Because I don't believe in you

And I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Don't want to fall in love

Don't need security
I ain't no dog without a bone
Don't have no time for love
So stay the fuck away from me
Because I don't believe in you

And I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Don't want to fall in love

And I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Don't want to fall in love

This may sound a little rough
Don't want to fall in love
This may sound a little rough
Don't want to fall in love
This may sound a little fucked
Don't want to fall in love


Standing on the corner of
Stuart and the Avenue
Ripping up my transfer
And a photograph of you
You're a blur of my dead past 
And rotting existance
As I stand laughing 
On the corner of insignificance

Well, destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it's all fucked up

Seasons change as well as minds
And I'm a two faced clown
You're mommy's little nightmare
Driving daddy's car around
I'm beat down and half brain dead
The long lost king of fools
I may be dumb
But I'm not stupid enough to stay with you

Well, destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it's all fucked up
[x2]

We're all fucked up...
You're all fucked up...
I lost my way, oh baby, 
This stray heart
Went to another.
Can you recover, baby?

Oh, you're the only one that
I'm dreaming of.
Your precious heart, 
Was torn apart by me.

And you, you're not alone!
Oh, and I'm where I belong.
We're not alone, oh, I'll hold your
Heart and never let go!

Everything that I want, I want from you,
But I just can't have you...
Everything that I need, I need from you,
But I just can't have you...

I said a thousand times 
And now a thousand one:
"We'll never part, 
I'll never stray again from you".

This dog is desperate for a 
Home to your heart.
We'll never part, 
I'll never stray again from you.

You're not alone,
Oh and I'm where I belong.
We're not alone, oh, I'll hold your 
Heart and never let go!

Everything that I want, I want from you,
But I just can't have you...
Everything that I need, I need from you,
But I just can't have you...

You're not alone!
Oh and I'm where I belong.
We're not alone, oh, I'll hold your 
Heart and never let go!

Everything I want, I want from you,
But I just can't have you...
Everything I need, I need from you,
But I just can't have you...

Everything I want, I want from you,
But I just can't have you...
Everything I need, I need from you,

To find something in a size four.

She, she is my wild one
My heart is in a panic
Her eyes look so manic now

She, little wild one
My heart is a chaser
She's strung out on razors now

She gave up on Jesus
For living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I'm drinking the Kool aid
I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow

Hello

She, she's my wild one
My heart is in danger
From shadows and strangers now

She, little wild one
She's covered in angels
And demons and halos now

For living on venus

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
wake me up when September ends

Like my father’s come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends



Wake Me Up When September Ends

  Like we did when spring began

I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
I'll never do exactly what I want
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance

I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
I'll never do exactly what I want
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance

And I feel forgotten
Feel like rotting
(Do you feel the same?)
(Do you feel the same?)
Adolescence
Just can't make sense
(It's calling my name)
(It's calling my name)

I take a look around
And all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop a while
And maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that
We're all the same

It's just like our brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain

All my life I've seemed to have this need
I think at times it even turns to greed
We all want to join some family
We'll even sacrifice a moral changing

And I feel forgotten
Feel like rotting
(Do you feel the same?)
(Do you feel the same?)
Adolescence
Just can't make sense
(It's calling my name)
(It's calling my name)

I take a look around
And all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop a while
And maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that
We're all the same

It's just like our brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain

I take a look around
And all the things I've found

And maybe if you'd smile

When it goes insane
We feel the same pain





Ashley! 
Are you running around? 
Now you're crying at a bloody murder 
Ashley! 
Are you bumming around? 
You are crying on my cold shoulder 

Used a tangled mind with your puppet strings 
You tangled your desires right in front of my face 
You let me into the world but wouldn't let me drink 
Swallowing my pride and I never even got the taste 

But time comes around and I'm not so naive 
I've finally lost touch cause you're so out of reach 
You say that you're fine but I know that you ain't 
You're looking like hell and you're no fucking saint 

Ashley! 
Are you running around? 
Now you're crying at a bloody murder 
Ashley! 
Are you bumming around? 
You are crying on my cold shoulder 

Ashley! 
Are you running around? 
Now you're crying at a bloody murder 
Ashley! 
Are you bumming around? 
You are crying on my cold shoulder 

You are what you are 
A wish on a shooting star 
You are a filthy thought 
In my memory 

I've tasted cigarettes and liquor on your breath 
You used to call it speed but now it's crystal meth 
Like when I loved you but you're scaring me to death 
This careless memory 
And now I could care less 

But time comes around and I'm not so naive 
I've finally lost touch cause you're so out of reach 
You say that you're fine but I know that you ain't 
You're looking like hell and you're no fucking saint 

Ashley! 
Are you running around? 
Now you're crying at a bloody murder 
Ashley! 
Are you bumming around? 
You are crying on my cold shoulder 

Ashley! 
Are you running around? 
Now you're crying at a bloody murder 
Ashley! 
Are you bumming around? 
You are crying on my cold shoulder 

Ashley! Ashley! Ashley!
  She puts her makeup on
    Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
    She's got her little book of conspiracies
    Right in her hand
    She is paranoid like
    Endangered species headed into extinction
    She is one of a kind
    She's the last of the American girls


  She wears her overcoat
    For the coming of the nuclear winter
    She is riding her bike
    Like a fugitive of critical mass
    She's on a hunger strike
    For the ones who won't make it for dinner
    She makes enough to survive
    For a holiday of working class

  She's a runaway of the establishment incorporated.
    She won't cooperate
        She's the last of the American girls

  She plays her vinyl records
    Singing songs on the eve of destruction
    She's a sucker for
    All the criminals breaking the laws
    She will come in first
    For the end of western civilization
    She's an endless war
    Like a hero for the lost cause
    Like a hurricane
    In the heart of the devastation
    She's a natural disaster
        She's the last of the American girls

[Billy Joe]:
Taking a ride to my old haunt
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favourite color's candy apple, girl (hahahah)
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife

[Lady Cobra]:
What's that I hear?  You wanna go for a ride?
Don't be afraid, boy, to come inside
I got the thing that you want, the fix that you need
Chase this with a little lust and greed
I'll be the devil on your shoulder saying "Hey boy, come on"
For my black heart beats crimson and clover
So operator, operator patch my boy in
This is nightlife and I'll get under your skin

[Billy Joe]:
Taking a ride to my old haunt
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favourite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife

[Lady Cobra]:
Short of breath, heart beats fast
Sounds like love but you know it won't last
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit
Hope there's more in your pants than a bus route
Red velvet walls, line the sugar-coated halls
Girls hang on bar stools for late last calls
This town is filled with snakes, mistakes and whiskey shakes
It's too late I already cut the brakes

[Billy Joe, Lady Cobra]:
Well I am rollin', strollin' into town (come inside)
Is it me or am I going crazy? (it's just you)
This dirty city is my Sugar Town (Sugar Town)
My little angel of death is my nightlife (get me up)

[Lady Cobra]:

(come inside)
(it's just you)
(Sugar Town)

You better make a move before I get bored
If you wanna explore my vocal cord
Leave the girl a go-go dance in the cooch
One hand on my knee one hand on the hooch
Why don't you stick around for one more round?
This place is a circus and I know you'll be my clown
Cause I'm a ringleader.  I run the show
And only when I tell ya. Will it be time to go

[Billy Joe]:
Taking a ride to my old haunt
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favourite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife

[Lady Cobra, Billy Joe]:
(hey boy) she is my night life
(hey boy) she is my night life
(haha hey boy) she is my night life
(see you later) she is my night life



I got under the grip
between the modern hell
I got the rejection letter in the mail and
it was already ripped to shreds.
Season's in a ruin and
This bitter pill is chased with blood.
There’s fire in my vein
And it’s not pouring out like a flood

Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno

This diabolic state is gracing my existence
Like a catasrophic baby
Maybe Maybe you’re the chemical reaction
I am the atom bomb
I am the chosen one
Toxin your reservoir
And then return man to ape

Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno


Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About NOTHING and EVERYTHING all at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm CRACKING UP
Am I just PARANOID?
Or am I just STONED

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
SHE says it's lack of sex
that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
HE said my life's a bore
So quit my whining cause
it's bringing HER down

Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm CRACKING UP
Am I just PARANOID?
Uh,yuh,yuh,ya

Grasping to CONTROL
So I BETTER hold on

Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm CRACKING UP
Am I just PARANOID?
Or am I just STONED


Hey, you got yourself a pretty little mouth
I think I wanna rub it the wrong way
Do you wanna spin a bottle, play a game of chicken?
Well, it's a tongue twister till your lips are bleeding

Oh, anyhow, anywhere
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Oh, scream and shout, truth or dare
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there

Oh, you're so precious, you're a fucking delinquent
Well, I got myself jonesin' and I need some fixin'
It's a makeout party on another dimension
And I'm gonna get crowded with a bad intention

Oh, anyhow, anywhere
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Oh, scream and shout, truth or dare
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there

Oh, you're so precious, you're a fucking delinquent
Well, I got myself jonesin' and I need some fixin'
It's a makeout party on another dimension
And I'm gonna get crowded with a bad intention

Oh, anyhow, anywhere
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Oh, scream and shout, truth or dare
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
You can kiss me here
K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K- kiss me there





All my life trouble follows me
Like a mystery girl
I've been chasing down a memory
Like a mystery girl

I've been getting lost searching my soul
All around this town
I took a wrong turn at growing up
And it's freaking me out

Back at school it never made much sense
Now I pay but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life

Too dumb to die I guess
But that's the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex, drugs and violence
English, math and science 
Safety in numbers
Gimme gimme danger

Well I don't wanna be an imbecile
But Jesus made me that way

All my life I've been running wild
Like a runaway
Where the night takes me
Like a stowaway

Back at home it never made much sense
Now I pay but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life

Too dumb to die I guess
But that's the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex, drugs and violence
English, math and science 
Safety in numbers
Gimme gimme danger

Back at home it never made much sense
Now I pay but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life

Too dumb to die I guess
But that's the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex, drugs and violence
English, math and science 
Safety in numbers
Gimme gimme danger

Sex, drugs and violence
English, math and science 
Safety in numbers
Gimme gimme danger

Sex, drugs and violence
English, math and science 
Safety in numbers
Gimme gimme danger
I see you, down in the front line. 
Such a sight for sore eyes, you're a suicide makeover. 
Plastic eyes, lookin' through a numbskull. 
Self-effaced, what's his face. 
You erased yourself so shut up. 
You don't let up. 

You have a growth that must be treated 
Like a severed severe pain in the neck. 
You can smell it but you can't see it. 
No explanation identified 'cause you don't know. 
You don't say. 

And you got no reply. 
Hey you, where did you come from? 
Got a head full of lead, you're an inbred bastard son. 
All dressed up, red-blooded a mannequin 
Do or die, no reply, don't deny that you're synthetic. 
You're pathetic.
Where did you come from
Where have you been?
Looks like you fell into the trash bin

I'm catching' a train
I'm crashin' the car
Back in for daylight
Shooting for the stars

Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
Rat inside a maze
I've got no destination

‘Cause I'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same
Little boy named Train
Don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been

Serious people are funny to me
Funny people seem so serious
I'm always lost and nothing will change
Give me directions and I'll get lost again

Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
Rat inside a maze
I've got no destination

‘Cause I'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same
Little boy named Train
Don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been

Say!

Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
Rat inside a maze
I've got no destination

‘Cause I'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same
Little boy named Train
I don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been

I said I don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been
Virginia was a lot lizard from F.L.A.
She had a compund fracture in the trunk
It started when she ran away
Thumbs out on the interstate
She hitched a ride to Misery

Mr. Whirly had a catastrophic incident
He fell into the city by the bay
He liquidated his estate
Now he sleeps up on the Haight
Panhandling Misery

And he's gonna get high high high
When he's low low low
The fire burns from better days
And she screams why oh why
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of Misery

Well Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam 
He ran the drug cartel in Tinsel Town 
They found him in a Cadillac
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat 
In the name of Misery

Then Gina hit the road to New York City
Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked
She stopped in Vegas to elope
With Virginia and a dope
Who kissed the bride eternally

And they're gonna get high high high
When they're low low low
The fire burns from better days
And she screams why oh why
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of Misery

Well hell's hounds on your trail now once again, boy 
It's groping on your leg until it sleeps11 
The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow 
'Cuz it's not what you make, it's what you leave

And we're gonna get high high high
When we're low low low
The fire burns from better days
And she screams why oh why
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of Misery


St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway 
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade 
Light of the silhouette 
He's insubordinate 
Coming at you on account of 1,2. 
1, 2, 3, 4. 

My name is Jimmy 
And you better not wear it out 
Suicide commando that your momma talked about 
King of the forty theives 
And I'm here to represent 
That needle in the vein of the establishment 

I'm the patron saint of the denial 
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal 

Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope 
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allen Poe 
Raised in the city in the hail of lights 
The product of war and fear that we've been victimized

I'm the patron saint of the denial 
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal 

You talkin' to me? 

I'll give you something to cry about. 

ST. JIMMY! 

My name is St. Jimmy I'm a son of a gun 
I'm the one that's from the way outside
A teenage assasin executing some fun 
In the cult of the life of crime 

I really hate to say it 
But I told you so 
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down old boy 
Welcome to the club and give me some blood 
And the resident leader 
At the lost and found 

It's comedy and tragedy 
It's St. Jimmy 
And that's my nameeeeeee. 
... and don't wear it out!


Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round 
Like a Ferris wheel that's breakin' down 
Drinkin' angel's piss, gonna crash and burn 
I just want some action so give me my turn 

Like a Chinese company conspiracy 
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you 
It's looking like another bad comedy 
Just as long as it comes
In high-fidelity for me too

Can you hear the sound coming over the hill? 
Gotta move my feet, it's coming in for the kill 
B-baby, baby, it's a blow out! Oh yeah! 
Like a nuclear bomb and it won't be long 'til I detonate! 

Like a Chinese company conspiracy 
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you 
It's looking like another bad comedy 
Just as long as it comes
In high-fidelity for me too

Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round 
Like a Ferris wheel, that's breakin' down 
Scream, scream, screaming bloody murder! Oh yeah 
Like a nuclear bomb and it won't be long 'til I detonate 

Like a Chinese company conspiracy 
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you 
It's looking like another bad comedy 
Just as long as it comes
In high-fidelity for me too





I declare I don't care no more 
I'm burning up and out and growing bored 
In my smoked out boring room 
My hair is shagging in my eyes 
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight 
To drive along these shit town lights 

I'm not growing up, 
I'm just burning out 
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead 

Apathy has rained on me 
Now I'm feeling like a soggy dream 
So close to drowning but 
I don't mind I've lived in this mental cave 
Throw emotions in the grave 
Hell, who needs them anyway

I'm not growing up, 
I'm just burning out 
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
I'm taking down all my enemies
  'Cause they're all so fucking useless
  A bunch of shit talking drama queens
  And they're all filled with excuses

I wanna find me a better scene
  Where it's not the same opinion
  I'd rather go to a funeral
  Than to this high school reunion

April Fool!
  Thought you're falling in love
  But now you're sucking on a doorknob
  That I slammed in your face
  Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime
  You're a stupid mother fucker
  And you're doing the time

We're all crazy
  You're all crazy now
  Well we're so crazy
  You've all gone insane
  Loss of control

Hanging out all by myself
  At least I make good company
  Hey isn't that old what's his face
  That I see walking down the street

I'm gonna hide in the shadows
  Cause I really got nothing to say
  We never had anything in common
  And I never liked you anyway

April Fool!
  Thought you were falling in love
  But now you're sucking on a doorknob
  That I slammed in your face
  Life's a cruel crushing son of a bitch
  And you're a stupid mother fucker
  Serving shit to the pigs

We're all crazy
  You're all crazy now
  Well we're so crazy
  You've all gone insane
  Loss of control

April Fool!
  Thought you're falling in love
  But now you're sucking on a doorknob
  That I slammed in your face
  Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime
  You're a stupid mother fucker
  And you're doing the time

We're all crazy
  You're all crazy now
  Well we're so crazy
  You've all gone insane
  Loss of control 


[Chorus:]
Dreaming
I am only dreaming
Of another place and time
Where my family’s from
Singing
I can hear them singing
When the rain had washed away
All these scattered dreams
Dying
Everyone’s reminded
Hearts are washed in misery
Drenched in gasoline
Laughter
There is no more laughter
Songs of yesterday
Now live in the underground

Life before the lobotomy
Christian sang the eulogy
Sign my love a lost memory
From the end of the century

Well it’s enough to make you sick
To cast a stone and throw a brick
When the sky is falling down
It burned your dreams into the ground

Christian’s lesson is what he’s been sold,
We are normal and self-controlled,
Remember to learn to forget,
Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes

Well I’m not stoned
I’m just fucked up
I got so high I can’t stand up
I’m not cursed cause I’ve been blessed
I’m not in love cause I’m a mess

Life refuges
We’re lost like refugees
Like refugees
We're lost like refugees
The brutality of reality
Is the freedom that keeps me from dreaming

[Chorus:]
Dreaming
I am only dreaming
Of another place and time
Where my family’s from
Singing
I can hear them singing
When the rain had washed away
All these scattered dreams
Dying
Everyone’s reminded
Hearts are washed in misery
Drenched in gasoline
Laughter
There is no more laughter
Songs of yesterday
Now live in the underground



Now I rest my head from
Such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness
That had you on my mind
Those days are gone and now it seems
As if I'll get some rest
But now and then I'll see you again
And it puts my heart to test

So when are all my troubles going to end? 
I'm understanding now that we are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you

As the days go on I wonder
will this ever end? 
I find it hard to keep control
When you're with your boyfriend
I do not mind if all I am is
Just a friend to you
But all I want to know right now
Is if you think about me too? 

So when are all my troubles going to end? 
I'm understanding now that we are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you...

Paper Lanterns

Now I rest my head from such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness that had you on my mind
Those days are gone and now it seems
As if I'll get some rest but now and then I'll see you again
And it puts my heart to test

So when are all my troubles going to end? 
I'm understanding now that we are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you

As the days go on I wonder will this ever end? 
I find it hard to keep control when you're with your boyfriend
I do not mind if all I am is just a friend to you
But all I want to know right now
Is if you think about me too? 

So when are all my troubles going to end? 
I'm understanding now that we are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you...


Seventeen and strung out on confusion
  Trapped inside a roll of disillusion
  I found out what it takes to be a man
  Well, Mom and Dad will never understand

Secrets collecting dust but never forget
  SKELETONS come to LIFE in my closet

I found out what it takes to be a man
  Well, Mom and Dad will never understand
  WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME

Seventeen and COMING CLEAN for the first time
  I finally figured out myself for the first time
  I found out what it takes to be a man
  Well, Mom and Dad will never understand
  WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME 


Coming Clean

Seventeen and strung out on confusion
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion
I found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad will never understand

Secrets collecting dust but never forget
SKELETONS come to LIFE in my closet

I found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad will never understand
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME

Seventeen and COMING CLEAN for the first time
I finally figured out myself for the first time
I found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad will never understand
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME
To know you is to hate you
So loving you must be like suicide
I don't mind if you don't mind
I'm not the one that's going to die

I guess I just can't listen
To this one sided conversation again
'cause I don't care if I don't care
No one ever said that life is fair

Everybody loves a joke
But no one likes a fool
And you're always cracking the same old lines again
You're well rehearsed on every verse
And that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity

The center of attention
Got an honerable mention once again
Congratulations and salutations
You're a figment of your own imagination

Everybody loves a joke
But no one likes a fool
And you're always cracking the same old lines again
You're well rehearsed on every verse
And that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity

To know you is to bait you
And you fell victim to your own denial
I don't mind if you don't mind
If you're wasting all your time




Jackass
To know you is to hate you 
So loving you must be like suicide 
I don't mind if you don't mind 
I'm not the one that's going to die 

I guess I just can't listen

`cause I don't care if I don't care 
No one ever said that life is fair 

Everybody loves a joke

And you're always cracking the same old lines again 
You're well rehearsed on every verse

[Verse 1:]
I'm like a child looking off in the horizon,
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens,
Oh, I'm still alive.
I'm like a soldier coming home for the first time,
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine,
Oh, I'm still alive.
Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage, so far away, away.

[Chorus:]
‘Cause I'm still breathing,
‘Cause I'm still breathing on my own,
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, my way.
‘Cause I'm still breathing,
‘Cause I'm still breathing on my own,
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, my way,
My way to you.

[Verse 2:]
I'm like a junkie tying off for the last time,
I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime,
Oh, I'm still alive.
I'm like a son that was raised without a father,
I'm like a mother barely keeping it together,
Oh, I'm still alive.
Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage, so far away, away.

[Chorus:]
‘Cause I'm still breathing,
‘Cause I'm still breathing on my own,
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, my way.
‘Cause I'm still breathing,
‘Cause I'm still breathing on my own,
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, my way, my way...

[Bridge:]
As I walked out on the ledge,
Are you scared to death to live?
I been running all my life
Just to find a home that's for the restless,
And the truth that's in the message,
Making my way, away, away.

[Chorus:]
‘Cause I'm still breathing,
‘Cause I'm still breathing on my own,
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, my way.
‘Cause I'm still breathing,
‘Cause I'm still breathing on my own,
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, my way, my way...
‘Cause I'm still breathing,
‘Cause I'm still breathing on my own,
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, my way,
My way to you.
I sit around and watch the tube but nothing's on
  I change the channels for an hour or two
  Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
  I'm sick of all the same old shit
  In a house with unlocked doors 
  And I'm fucking lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
  Take me away to paradise
  I'm so damn bored I'm going blind
  And I smell like shit

Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
  I sure as hell can't do it by myself
  I'm feeling like a dog in heat
  Barred indoors from the summer street
  I locked the door to my own cell 
  And I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
  Take me away to paradise
  I'm so damn bored I'm going blind
  And I smell like shit

I got no motivation
  Where is my motivation?
  No time for the motivation
  Smoking my inspiration

I sit around and watch the phone, 
  But no one's calling
  Call me pathetic, call me what you will
  My mother says to get a job
  But she don't like the one she's got
  When masturbation's lost its fun 
  You're fucking lonely

So, bite my lip and close my eyes
  Take me away to paradise
  I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
  And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes
  I'm slipping away to paradise
  Some say, quit or I'll go blind
  But it's just a myth






Amanda don't you know
That I still walk around
This foggy roundabout
When I get back in town.
I was a different man
From five seconds ago
And you're a different woman,
That's for certain,
I don't know a thing about.

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand?
Amanda, I couldn't be your man.

Amanda don't you know
I wasn't strong enough
And in your wild mind
I wasn't smart enough.
I was a different kid
From fifteen years ago
And you're a different woman,
That's for certain,
I wanna know about.

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand?
Amanda, I couldn't be your man.

I'm not playin' with your mind
Unless you think I am.
'Cause you're crushing my heart
Like a battering ram.

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand?
Amanda, I couldn't be your man.


Amanda

Amanda, don't you know?
That I still walk around
This foggy roundabout
When I get back in town

I was a different man
From five seconds ago
And you're a different woman that's for certain
I don't know a thing about
Is this a kind of love that only hate would understand
Amanda, I couldn't be your man

Amanda, don't you know
I wasn't strong enough
And in your wild mind
I wasn't smart enough

I was a different kid
From 15 years ago
And you're a different woman that's for certain
I wanna know about
Is this a kinda love that only hate would understand
Amanda, I couldn't be your man

I'm not playing with your mind
Unless you think I am
Cause you're crushing my heart
Like a battering-ram

Is this a kinda love that only hate would understand
Amanda, I couldn't be your man
I'm too tired to be bored.
I'm too bored to be tired.
And the silence is so deafening.
It's like picking at a sore.

I'm too mental to go crazy.
I'm too drunk to be pure.
And my mind is playing tricks on me.
And I can't sleep tonight.
Cuz I'm so tired.

I can't take it anymore.
And with all the liars
Like a prisoner of war.

I don't want your sympathy.
I don't want your honesty.
I just wanna get some peace of mind.

It's only in my head.
As I role over and play dead.
I don't wanna hear it anymore.

It's good to see you,
But I really must admit
There's an odor in the air.
And I think you look like shit.

I can't stand from falling down.
I'm too sick to throw up.
Everyone keeps talking,
And they can't shut the fuck up.
Cuz I'm so tired.

I can't take it anymore.
And with all the liars
Like a prisoner of war.

I don't want your sympathy.
I don't want your honesty.
I just wanna get some peace of mind.

It's only in my head.
As I role over and play dead.
I don't wanna hear it anymore.

I don't want your sympathy.
I don't want your honesty.
I just wanna get some peace of mind.

It's only in my head.
As I role over and play dead.
I don't wanna hear about it!
I don't wanna scream about it!
I don't wanna hear it any more.
Come together like a foot in a shoe 
Only this time I think I stuck my foot in my mouth 
Thinking out loud and acting in vain 
Knocking over anyone that stands in my way 

Sometimes I need to apologize 
Sometimes I need to admit that I ain't right 
Sometimes I should just keep my mouth shut, or only say hello 
Sometimes I still feel I'm walking alone 

Walk on eggshells on my old stomping ground, 
Yet there's really no one left, that's hanging around 
Isn't that another familiar face? 
Too drunk to figure out they're fading away
I'll drop your laundry and slam the door.
  I don't want your love so give me more!
  I'm a beggar but I don't want a dime

Oh baby baby it's fuck time.
  You know I really wanna make you mine.
  Oh baby baby it's fuck time.
  There's nothing left to say.

Take a look into my eyes.
  I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed.

Oh Amanda Jones, your holy grace!
  I wanna choke you 'til you're blue in the face,
  Your dirty thoughts and a dirty mind.

Oh baby baby it's fuck time.
  You know I really wanna make you mine.
  Oh baby baby it's fuck time.
  There's nothing left to say.

Take a look into my eyes.
  I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed.

Take a look into my eyes.
  I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed.
  Take a look into my eyes.
  I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed. 



Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone
The worry rock has turned to dust and fallen on our pride

A knocked down dragged out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
And no one will take the fall

Where do we go from here? 
And what did you do with the directions? 
Promise me no dead end streets 
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road

A knocked down dragged out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
And no one will take the fall

Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud
Where do we go from here? 
And what did you do with the directions? 
Promise me no dead end streets 
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road...
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road...
Starlit night
The moon is shining bright
You are the one I need
Up at your window
I see a shadow
Silhouette of your grace
Here's this flower
I picked for all the hours
That you've spent with me
The one I love
That I've been dreaming of
Sailing across the sea

Let my hands flow through
Your hair. 
Moving closer
A kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, 
As one too strong

Nothing's more
Than what our love is for
As I kiss your cheek
Oh so softly
Hands flowing down my back
1,000 hours, I'll never leave
Our romance
Is a love trance
And now we'll never part
1,000 hours
Of such a love shower
We'll never stop, once we start

Let my hands flow through
Your hair. 
Moving closer
A kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, 
As one too strong

Let my hands flow through
Your hair. 
Moving closer
A kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, 
As one too strong

Strrrooooonnnggg...


Born into Nixon I was raised in hell.
A welfare child where the Teamsters dwelled.
The last one born and the first one to run.
My town was blind from refinery sun.

[Chorus:]
My generation is zero.
I never made it as a working class hero.
21st century breakdown.
I was once lost, but never was found.
I think I am losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline.

I was made of posion and blood.
Condemnation is what I understood.
Videogames of the tower's fall.
Homeland security could kill us all.

[Chorus]

We are the cries of the class of thirteen.
Born in the era of humility.
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969.

My name is No One, the long lost son
Born on the 4th of July.
Raised in the era of heroes and cons,
That left me for dead or alive.

I am a nation, a worker of pride.
My debt to status quo.
The scars on my hands and the means to an end
Is all that I have to show.

I swallowed my pride and I chocked on my faith,
I've given my heart and my soul.
I've broken my fingers and lied through my teeth -
The pillar of damage control.

I've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquet
Of flowers left over the grave.
I sat in the waiting room wasting my time
And waiting for Judgement Day.

I praise liberty.
The "Freedom to Obey".
Is the song that strangles me.
Don't cross the line...

Dream, American Dream.
I can't even sleep
From the light's early dawn.

Scream, America scream.
Believe what you see
From heroes and cons?




21 Century Breakdown

Born into Nixon I was raised in hell.
A welfare child where the Teamsters dwelled.
The last one born and the first one to run.
My town was blind from refinery sun.

My generation is zero
I never made it 
As a working class hero

21st century breakdown
I was once lost but never was found
I think I am losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline.

I was made of posion and blood
Condemnation is what I understood

Videogames of the tower's fall
Homeland security could kill us all

My generation is zero
I never made it 
As a working class hero

21st century breakdown
I was once lost but never was found
I think I am losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline.

We are the [cries of] the class of '13 
Born in the era of humility
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969

My name is No One
The long lost son
Born on the 4th of July
Raised in the era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive

I am a nation

My debt to status quo

The scars on my hands
And the means to an end
Is all that I have to show

I swallowed my pride
And I chocked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I’ve broken my fingers
And lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control

I've been to the edge
And I've thrown the bouquet
Of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room
Wasting my time
And waiting for Judgement Day

I praise liberty
The "Freedom to Obey"
Is the song that strangles me
Don't cross the line

Dream, American Dream
I can't even sleep
From the light's early dawn

Scream, America scream

Turn out the light
Close your eyes
Turn up the silence
The heartache of your life
Dance forever
Under the lights
This brutal love

Oh how you want it
You're begging for it
But you can't have it
Even if you try
It's in the clutches
In the hands of
This brutal love

Old toys
This plastic heart
Loners and fools
Are tearing me apart
Here comes trouble
The uninvited
This brutal love

Danger
Not quite at home
The eyes of temptation
The flesh on my bones
Hello stranger
I'm a disaster
This brutal love

Bad luck
Pities and soda
Anguish and shame
The modern fool
Bad sex
Buy me a train wreck
Something for my troubled
Mind

Bad luck
Pities and soda
Anguish and shame
The modern fool
Bad love
Kiss me I'm roded
Something for my troubled
Mind

Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
This brutal love





Brutal Love

Turn out the light
Close your eyes 
Turn up the silence
The heartache of your life
Dance forever
Under the lights

Oh how you want it
You're begging for it

It's in the clutches
In the hands of

[Verse 1:]
Scream with your hands up in the sky
Like you want to testify
For the life that's been deleted.
Sing like a rebel's lullaby
Under the stars and stripes
For the lost souls that were cheated.
We will be seen but not be heard.

[Chorus:]
We are Revolution Radio
Operation 'No Control',
And the headline 'My love's bullet proof'.
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline,
Debutantes in surgery,
And the headline 'Legalize the truth'.

[Verse 2:]
Give me rage like there's teargas in the crowd,
Do you wanna live out loud?
But the air is barely breathing.
Rise of the slums to the obsolete,
The dawn of the new airwaves for the anti-social media.

[Chorus:]
We are Revolution Radio
Operation 'No Control',
And the headline 'My love's bullet proof'.
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline,
Debutantes in surgery,
And the headline 'Legalize the truth'.

We will be seen but not be heard,
We are the songs of the disturbed.

[Chorus:]
We are Revolution Radio
Operation 'No Control',
And the headline 'My love's bullet proof'.
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline,
Debutantes in surgery,
And the headline 'Legalize the truth'.
I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted in a daze
It should seem obvious to you
Your screams and cries are never going to work
And all of your time gets wasted in my daze

And I'm looking back now at where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing to break from these chains
These chains that control 
My future's aim...

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted in a daze
Maybe I'm just too damn lazy
Or maybe I was just brainwashed 
To think that way
And all of your time gets wasted in my daze

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break from these chains
These chains that control
My future's aim...


409 In Your Coffeemaker

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted 
In a daze
It should seem obvious to you
Your screams and cries are never going to work
And all of your time gets wasted 
In my daze

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along my interests are longing
To break from these chains these chains that control my future's aim...

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted in a daze
Maybe I'm just too damn lazy
Or maybe I was just brainwashed 
To think that way
And all of your time gets wasted 
In my daze

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along my interests are longing
To break from these chains these chains that control my future's aim...








Shoplifter, you'll never learn
When you commit the crime
Shoplifter, you're getting burned
And now you gotta do the time

It's a 1 2 3 on the felony
Well not everything is free
Now that you served the community
It's the life of a Burley thief

It's not considered stealing
Unless you're getting caught
But you've been caught stealing
Tryin' to take something you haven't got

Shoplifter, you'll never learn
What lies behind your back
Not a burglar or a bank robber
Just a kleptomaniac

It's not considered stealing
Unless you're getting caught
But you've been caught stealing
Tryin' to take something you haven't got

Shoplifter, you'll never learn
When you commit the crime
Shoplifter, you're getting burned
And now you gotta do the time
And now you gotta do the time
And now you gotta do some time
Uncomfortable silence
I'll kill it if you want me to
I'm like ultraviolet
I'll kill it if you want me to

Out of sight, out of mind
I'm not the hurting kind
I'll make you surrender [x4]

Stop when the red lights flash
I'll trade you blood for dirty cash
Life in the catacombs
You make me feel like I'm at home

Out of sight, out of mind
I'm not the hurting kind
I'll make you surrender [x4]

Out of sight, out of mind
Just give in one more time
I'll make you surrender [x4]
All brawn and no brains
And all those nice things
You finally got what you want
Someone to look good with
And light your cigarette
Is this what you really want ?

I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
SOOOOO...
I hope I won't be there
In the end if you come around

How long will he last
Before he's a creep in the past
And you're alone once again?
Will you pop up again and be my
special friend 'till the end?
And when will that be?

I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
SOOOOO...
I hope I won't be there
In the end if you come around



Waking up feeling naked
In my clothes, inside a room that's vacant
Lost my nerve, it's unnerving
I know there is something I'm forgetting

I searched the moon, I lost my head, 
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the streets
I'm pounding the pavement looking

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around and I'm a complete disaster
I'm missing you

Remember, was our first time
I told you I loved you at the bus station
Don't forget, cause it's not over
I'm not lost cuz I'm just missing you

I searched the moon, I lost my head, 
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the streets
I'm pounding the pavement looking

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around and I'm a complete disaster
I'm missing you

Say hey! 

Well she's my bud
And she's my soul
I get so lost
Out in the cold

Feels so far
Like this lone star
It gets so hard
When I'm missing you

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around and I'm a fuckin disaster
I'm missing you
3 a.m., I'm drunk again
My head is standing underneath my puke
So make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off

Sedatives and dizzy spells
And spilling my guts beneath my puke
So make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop I'm getting off

Well, slipped into a coma once again
Where's my organ donor to lend a hand

So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
'Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate

One night stands and cheap regrets
I take another drag off of my cigarette
So stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off

One last stop for one track mind
Just give me shelter, give me give me something
Make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off

Well, slipped into a coma once again
Where's my organ donor to lend a hand

So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
'Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate

So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
'Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
'Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate.
I don't wanna go back home
I don't wanna kiss goodnight
Let us paralyze this moment
'til it dies

To the end of the earth
Under the valley of the stars
There's a car crashing
Deep inside my heart

Take a ride to the avenues
Across the Great Divide
There's a siren screaming
"I'm alive", it cries

Red alert is the color
Of your paper valentines
Intertwined on this moment
Passing by

Take a ride through the avenues
Across the Great Divide
There's a siren screaming
"I'm alive", it cries

Red alert is the color
Of your paper valentines
Intertwined on this moment
Passing by

Oh, come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines

Cigarettes and valentines!

So, come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines

Oh, come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines

Cigarettes and valentines!
Do you know what's worth fighting for,
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky,
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky,
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home? 
Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky 

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky,
You and I



21 Guns

Do you know what's worth fighting for,
  When it's not worth dying for?
  Does it take your breath away
  And you feel yourself suffocating?
  Does the pain weigh out the pride?
  And you look for a place to hide?
  Did someone break your heart inside?
  You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
  Lay down your arms
  Give up the fight
  One, 21 guns
  Throw up
  Your arms into the sky,
  You and I

When you're at the end of the road
  And you lost all sense of control
  And your thoughts have taken their toll
  When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
  Your faith walks on broken glass
  And the hangover doesn't pass
  Nothing's ever built to last
  You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
  Lay down your arms
  Give up the fight
  One, 21 guns
  Throw up
  Your arms into the sky,
  You and I

Did you try to live on your own
  When you burned down the house and home?
  Did you stand too close to the fire?
  Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

When it's time to live and let die
  And you can't get another try
  Something inside this heart has died
  You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
  Lay down your arms
  Give up the fight
  One, 21 guns
  Throw up
  Your arms into the sky

One, 21 guns
  Lay down your arms
  Give up the fight
  One, 21 guns
  Throw up
  Your arms into the sky,
  You and I

You gotta problem you just can't hide
Compulsive habits that never seem to die
Your breath has taken up all the air
Your teeth are rotting 
To black holes in your head

Well reality is due 
What you say just can't be true
When the story is stretched and so far-fetched
That you're lacking an excuse

You lied...

Your mother allowed you 
For just one white lie
But now she's dead
And she left you with a problem
Pinocchio has pierced your tongue
Your nose is growin'
Into the 3rd dimension

Well reality is due 
What you say just can't be true
When the story is stretched and so far-fetched
That you're lacking an excuse

You lied...

Well reality is due 
What you say just can't be true
When the story is stretched and so far-fetched
That you're lacking an excuse

You lied...
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I do
I got a sentimental illness for you
Please don't go away, oh yeah

I was a high school atom bomb
Going off on the weekends
Smoking dope and mowing lawns
And I hated all the new trends
Me and my friends sang
"Woah-uh-oh-oh-oh (woah-uh-oh)
Here's to the middle of the road
At least it's better than here"

Looking for a cause
But all I got was Santa Claus
I'm hanging on a dream 
That's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high, too scared to dream
But too dumb to die

My daddy always was on strike
Going off with the teamsters
He said that everything will be alright
Not every Sunday can be Easter
The picket line screamed
"Woah-uh-oh-oh-oh (woah-uh-oh)
Don't cross, don't cross the line
Because you'll be a scab, not a martyr"

[2x:]
Looking for a cause
But all I got was Camouflage
I'm hanging on a dream 
That's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high, too scared to dream
But too dumb to...

Die



Where in the world's the forgotten?
They're lost inside your memory.
You're dragging on, your heart's been broken
As we all go down in history.

Where in the world did the time go?
It's where your spirit seems to roam,
Like losing faith to our abandon,
Or an empty hallway from a broken home.

Well, don't look away from the arms of a bad dream,
Don't look away, 
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen.

I don't feel strange, it's more like haunted.
Another moment trapped in time,
I can't quite put my finger on it,
But it's like a child that was left behind.

So where in the world's the forgotten?
Like soldiers from a long lost war,
We share the scars from our abandon
And what we remember becomes folk lore.

Well, don't look away from the arms of a bad dream,
Don't look away, 
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen.

Don't look away from the arms of a moment.
Don't look away from the arms of tomorrow.
Don't look away from the arms of a moment.
Don't look away from the arms of love.

Well, don't look away from the arms of a bad dream,
Don't look away, 
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen.

Don't look away from the arms of a moment.
Don't look away from the arms of tomorrow.
Don't look away from the arms of a moment.
Don't look away from the arms of love.

Hey mister, where you headed?
Are you in a hurry?
Need a lift to happy hour.
Say oh no.
Do you brake for distilled spirits?
I need a break as well.
The well that inebriates the guilt.
1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4.

Cold turkey's getting stale, tonight I'm eating crow.
Fermented salmonella poison oak no

There's a drought at the fountain of youth, and now I'm dehydrating.
My tongue is swelling up, as say 1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Troubled times, you know I can not lie.
I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride.

There's a drought at the fountain of youth, and now I'm dehydrating.
My tongue is swelling up, I say shit!

Troubled times, you know I can not lie.
I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride.

I'm hitchin' a ride.
I'm hitchin' a ride.
I'm hitchin' a ride.
I'm hitchin' a ride.
I'm hitchin' a ride.
I'm hitchin' a ride.
I'm hitchin' a ride.


[Chorus:]
I want to be the minority 
I don't need your authority 
Down with the moral majority 
Cause I want to be the minority 

I pledge allegiance to the underworld 
One nation under dog 
There of which I stand alone 
A face in the crowd 
Unsung, against the mold 
Without a doubt 
Singled out 
The only way I know 

[Chorus:]
I want to be the minority 
I don't need your authority 
Down with the moral majority 
Cause I want to be the minority 

Stepped out of the line 
Like a sheep runs from the herd 
Marching out of time 
To my own beat now 
The only way I know 

One light, one mind 
Flashing in the dark 
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts 
"For crying out loud" she screamed unto me 
A free for all 
Fuck 'em all 
You are your own sight 

[Chorus:]
I want to be the minority 
I don't need your authority 
Down with the moral majority 
Cause I want to be the minority 


Breaking rocks in the hot sun 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the law won 
I needed the money 'cause I had none 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the law won 

I miss my baby and I feel so sad
I guess my race is run 
Well she's the best girl that I ever had 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the

Robin' people with a six gun 
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and I miss my fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I miss my baby and I feel so sad
I guess my race is run
Why she's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the

I fought the law and the law won [x7]
I fought the law and the
I was a young boy that had big plans
Now I'm just another shitty old man
I don't have fun and I hate everything
This world owes me so fuck you

Glory days don't mean shit to me
I drank a six pack of apathy
Life's a bitch and so am I
The world owes me so fuck you

Wasted youth and a fistful of ideas
I had a young and optimistic point of view
Wasted youth and a fistful of ideas
I had a young and optimistic point of view

I've decomposed yet my gut's getting fat
Oh my God, I'm turning out like my Dad
I'm always rude, I've a bad attitude
The world owes me so fuck you

The wife's a nag and the kids fucking up
I don't have sex 'cause I can't get it up
I'm just a grouch sitting on the couch
The world owes me so fuck you


Raise your hands now to testify
Your confession will be crucified
You’re a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog that’s been sodomized
Stand up! - All the white boys
Sit down! - All the black girls
You’re the soldiers of the new world

Put your faith in miracle
And it’s non-denominational
Join the choir we will be singing
In the church of wishful thinking

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Oh bless me lord for I have sinned
It’s been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in The River
Of a Shadow of Doubt
And i’ll be dressed in my Sunday best

Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain’t this uniform so flattering?
I never asked you a god damned thing!

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Don’t test me
Second guess me
Protest me
You will disappear!

I want to know who’s allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read?
Missionary politicians
And the cops of a new religion?

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the inside


Can you hear the sound of the static noise?
Blasting out in stereo
Cater to the class and the paranoid
Music to my nervous system
Advertising love and religion
Murder on the airwaves
Slogans on the brink of corruption
Vision of blasphemy, war and peace
Screaming at you

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

Billboard on the rise in the dawn's landscape
Working your insanity
Tragic a'la madness and concrete
Coca cola execution
Conscience on a cross and
Your heart's on a vice
Squeezing out your state of mind
Are what you own that you cannot buy?
What a fucking tragedy, strategy
Screaming at you

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

Hey, hey it's the static age
This is how the west was won
Hey, hey it's the static age millennium

All I want to know
It's a god-damned thing
Not what's in the medicine
All I want to do is
I want to breathe
Batteries are not included
What's the latest way that a man can die
Screaming hallelujah?
Singing out "the dawn's early light"
The silent of the rotten, forgotten
Screaming at you

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age
The static age


Juliet's trying to find out what she wants, but she don't know
Experience has got her down
Look this direction, I know it's not perfection, it's just me...
I want to bring you up again now

Cause' I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

Juliet's crying cause now 
She's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy, and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again now

Cause' I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

Juliet's crying cause now 
She's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy, and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again somehow

Cause' I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in



Well I met a girl named Lady Cobra
Her black heart beats crimson and clover
She gives me chills and fever blisters
She's serving spells and voodoo shakes

Well she just wants to get me high
Stick a needle in my eye
Reeks like hell, lost in temptation, rubbing on my inner demons
I don't wanna suicide, I don't want this to end
I just wanna be your friend

Cuddle up with me real tight
Talk to me by candlelight
Do you wanna play a game of Twister
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter?
I don't wanna suicide, I don't want this to end
I just wanna be your friend

I don't want to make you cry
Cross my heart and hope to die
Drawin' blood and lonely stars
Drinking piss for cheap guitars
I don't wanna suicide, I don't want this to end
I just want to be your friend

Oh, your friend



Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!) 
The shame the ones who died without a name 

Hear the dogs howlin' out of key
To a hymn called Faith and Misery (Hey!) 
And plead, the company lost the war today 

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 
On holiday 

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protestor has crossed the line (Hey!) 
To find, the money's on the other side

Can I get another Amen (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around the score of men (Hey!) 
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument 

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 
On holiday 

"The representative from California has the floor"

Zeig Heil to the president gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass man
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Triumph by fires, setting fire
It's not a way that's meant for me
Just cause
Just cuz we're on holiday

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives


Every time I'm falling down
You take the repurcussions
Headaches and anxieties
Advancing my frustrations

Rush into my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well now you're stuck with me

Hand up your soul to my wrist
And I'll vow my trust to you
Moving on and I always thought
I realized you've imagined

You take the repurcussions
Headaches and anxieties
Advancing my frustrations

Rush into my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well now you're stuck with me

Hand up your soul to my wrist
And I'll vow my trust to you
Moving on and I always thought
I realized you've imagined
Late last night I had a dream
And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that she'll dry the tears
Left on my face I've cried

Oh I love her, keep dreaming of her
Will I understand if she wants 
To be my friend?

I'd send a letter to that girl
Asking her to be my own
But my pen is writing wrong
So I'll say it in a song
Oh I love you more right now
More than I've ever loved before
Here's those words straight from these lips
I'll need you forever more

Oh I love her, keep dreaming of her
Will I understand if she wants 
To be my friend?

Late last night I had a dream
And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that she'll dry fears
Left on my face I've cried

Oh I love her, keep dreaming of her
Will I understand if she wants 
To be my friend?


Dry Ice

Late last night I had a dream
And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky
Flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that she'll dry the tears
Left on my face I've cried

Oh I love her, 
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand 
If she wants to be my friend?

I'd send a letter to that girl
Asking her to be my own
But my pen is writing wrong
So I'll say it in a song
Oh I love you more right now
More than I've ever loved before

I'll need you forever more

Oh I love her, 
Keep dreaming of her

If she wants to be my friend?

Late last night I had a dream

Flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that she'll dry fears
Left on my face I've cried

Oh I love her, 
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand 
If she wants to be my friend?


I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of suburbia 
From the bible of none of the above 
On a steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin 
No one ever died for my sins in hell 
As far as I can tell 
At least the ones I got away with 

And there's nothing wrong with me 
This is how I'm supposed to be 
In a land of make believe 
That don't believe in me

Get my television fix sitting on my crucifix 
The living room or my private womb 
While the moms and brads are away 
To fall in love and fall in debt 
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane 
To keep me insane and doing someone else's cocaine

And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That don't believe in me

At the center of the Earth
In the parking lot 
Of the 7-11 were I was taught 
The motto was just a lie 
It says home is where your heart is
But what a shame 
Cause everyone's heart 
Doesn't beat the same 
It's beating out of time 

City of the dead 
At the end of another lost highway 
Signs misleading to nowhere 
City of the damned 
Lost children with dirty faces today 
No one really seems to care 

I read the graffiti 
In the bathroom stall 
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall 
And so it seemed to confess 
It didn't say much 
But it only confirmed that
The center of the earth 
Is the end of the world 
And I could really care less 

City of the dead
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to careeeeee

I don't care if you don't 
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
[x4]

I don't careeeeeeeeee

Everyone is so full of shit 
Born and raised by hypocrites 
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave 
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the middle east 
We are the stories and disciples 
Of the Jesus of suburbia 
Land of make believe 
And it don't believe in me 
Land of make believe 
And I don't believe 
And I don't care! 
I don't care! [x4]

Dearly beloved are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed? 
The space that's in between insane and insecure 
Oh therapy, can you please fill the void? 
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed 
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused 
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse 

To live and not to breathe 
Is to die In tragedy
To run, to run away 
To find what you believe 
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies 
I lost my faith to this 
This town that don't exist

So I run 
I run away
To the light of masochist
And I leave behind 
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line 
A million and one fucking times
But not this time

I don't feel any shame
I won't apologize 

When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain
When you've been victimized
Tales from another broken home

You're leaving...
You're leaving...
You're leaving...
Ah you're leaving home...

She's an extraordinary girl,
In an ordinary world,
And she can't seem to get away

He lacks the courage in his mind,
Like a child left behind,
Like a pet left in the rain

She's all alone again,
Wiping the tears from her eyes

Somedays he feels like dying,
She gets so sick of crying

She sees the mirror of herself,
An image she wants to sell,
To anyone willing to buy

He steals the image in her kiss,
>From her hearts apocalypse,
>From the one called whatsername

She's all alone again,
Wiping the tears from her eyes

Somedays he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying

She's all alone again,
Wiping the tears from her eyes

Somedays he feels like dying
Somedays it's not worth trying,
Now that they both are finding,
She gets so sick of crying

She's an extraordinary girl, 
an extraordinary girl, 
an extraordinary girl, 
an extraordinary girl.


Olivia, Olivia, it's raining outside
The city is drenched, there's a moon out tonight
There's a break in the clouds, just under the stars
We wanna go out and watch from afar

We couldn't care when and stepped in the mud
It makes no sense but you misunderstood
The city is in ruins, but there's a flower in the crack of the streets

Olivia, Olivia, I'll give you my best
Safe in my arms, I'll lay you to rest
You can borrow my coat, you wear the dress
Olivia, Olivia, come follow me home
Hey!
You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest
When I'm standing at the traffic light
Hey!
I wanna get inside of you
I wanna crack your cranium delirium
On the lower east side of your mind

Wanna be a Troublemaker

Hey!
I like your BMW
I like your BM-excellent tits
With a tattoo of a pig sniffing glue
Hey!
You're living at the W
You're looking like a Jezebel, hot as hell
Sunburned in a pink bathing suit

Wanna be a Troublemaker

Hey!
Yeah!
Easy come and go, gonna go it alone
Knock yourself out with a shot of Patron
I wouldn't say I'm straight
'cause I'm bent out of shape
From now till death do we party
Just before it's too late
Hey!
You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest
When I'm standing at the traffic light

[Verse 1:]
  I walk a lonely road,
  The only one that I have ever known.
  Don't know where it goes,
  But it's home to me and I walk alone.

I walk this empty street
  On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams,
  Where the city sleeps
  and I'm the only one and I walk alone.

I walk alone,
  I walk alone.

[Chorus:]
  My shadow's the only one that walks beside me,
  My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating.
  Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me,
  'Til then I walk alone.

[Verse 2:]
  I'm walking down the line
  That divides me somewhere in my mind,
  On the border line,
  Of the edge and where I walk alone.

Read between the lines
  What's fucked up and everything's alright.
  Check my vital signs
  To know I'm still alive and I walk alone.

I walk alone,
  I walk alone.

[Chorus:]
  My shadow's the only one that walks beside me,
  My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating.
  Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me,
  'Til then I walk alone.




Boulevard of Broken Dreams

I walk a lonely road,
The only one that I have ever known
  Don't know where it goes
  But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
  On the Boulevard of broken dreams
  Where the city sleeps
  And I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone
  I walk alone
  I walk alone
  I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
  My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
  Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
  Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ahhh-ah
  Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah

I'm walking down the line
  That divides me somewhere in my mind
  On the border line of the edge
  And where I walk alone

Read between the lines
  What's fucked up and everything's all right
  Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
  And I walk alone

I walk alone
  I walk alone
  I walk alone
  I walk a...

Boulevard of Broken Dreams

I walk a lonely road

* - OST Supernatural (саундтрек к фильму «Сверхъестественное»)
Nice guys finish last.
You're running out of gas.
Your sympathy will get you left behind.

Sometimes you're at your best
When you look the worst.

Do you feel washed up
Like piss going down the drain?

Pressure cooker pick my brain 
And tell me I'm insane.
I'm so fucking happy I could cry!
Every joke can have it's truth and now the joke's on you.
I never knew you were such a funny guy!

Oh nice guys finish last.
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back,
You might break your spine.

Living on command
You're shaking lots of hands
Kissing up and bleeding all your trust
Taking what you need.
Bite the hand that feeds
You kill your memory.


Part 1 - "I'm Freaking Out"

My name is Billie and I'm freaking out
I thought therefore I was
Well I can't really figure it out
I sit alone with my thoughts and prayers
Scream out my memories
As if I was never there

Standing at the edge of the world
Is giving me the chills
Looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tango
It's freaking me out
Burning lights and blackouts

From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

I'm like a punk rocker on Labor Day
How the hell did I work so hard
To be born this way?
I never learned to read or write so well
(Freaking out)
But I can play the guitar until it hurts like hell

Standing at the edge of the world
Is giving me the chills
Looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tango
It's freaking me out
Burning lights and blackouts

From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

Part 2 - "A Better Way to Die"

If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die
If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die

Oh I don't want to think about tomorrow
Don't want to think about it, Oh
It doesn't matter anyway
Oh I wanna start a revolution
I want to hear it on my radio
I'll put it off another day

I want a new conspiracy
And the silence of a thousand cries
So hurry up
I want a better way to die

Part 3 - "Somewhere" (Reprise)

I'm running late to somewhere now
That I don't want to be
Where the future and promises
Ain't what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise
Or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side
Ever get so full?

Somewhere now [4x]

[2x:]
Oh I don't want to think about tomorrow
Don't want to think about it, Oh
It doesn't matter anyway
Oh I wanna start a revolution
I want to hear it on my radio
I'll put it off another day

(I ain't gonna stand in line no more!)




Waiting in a room
All dressed up and bound and gagged up to a chair 
It's so unfair

I won't dare to move
For the pain she puts me through
What I need
So make it bleed

I’m in distress
Oh mistress I confess so do it one more time 
These handcuffs are too tight well 
You know I will obey 
So please don't make me me beg 
For blood sex and booze you give me

Some say I’m disturbed
But it's what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned
From a girl called kill

My head is in the gutter
Thank you sir strike up another mandolin 
Or discipline 
Throw me to the dogs 
Let them eat my flesh down 
To the wood 
It feels so good

I’m in distress
Oh mistress I confess so do it one more time 
These handcuffs are too tight well 
You know I will obey 
So please don't make me me beg 
For blood sex and booze you give me

Say I’m disturbed
But it's what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned
From a girl called Kill

I’m in distress
Oh mistress I confess so do it one more time 
These handcuffs are too tight well 
You know I will obey 
So please don't make me me beg 
For blood sex and booze you give me


She's always living like she's running out of time
Too much just ain't enough to keep her satisfied
Her plastic card is filled with nothing comes to mind
It's now her occupation that she's overqualified

The looks are always so deceiving
The truth is always misconstrued

To you...
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too

He's talking shit about how it's better way back when
He lives every waking moment as means to an end
We are we are but I'm not
I never used to be
So god bless your fucking past and to hell with your glory

The looks are always so deceiving
The truth is always misconstrued

To you... 
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too

She packs her bags and says goodbye and bon voyage
Farewell we'll see you in hell I hope you rest in pieces
Fuck you

Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too



Another turning point,
A fork stuck in the road. 
Time grabs you by the wrist,
Directs you where to go. 
So make the best of this test 
And don't ask why. 
It's not a question 
But a lesson learned in time. 

[Chorus:]
It's something unpredictable, 
But in the end is right. 
I hope you had the time of your life. 

So take the photographs 
And still frames in your mind, 
Hang it on a shelf 
Of good health and good time.
Tattoos of memories 
And dead skin on trial. 
For what it's worth, 
It was worth all the while. 

[Chorus: 3x] 
It's something unpredictable, 
But in the end is right. 
I hope you had the time of your life.


Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)

Another turning point,
A fork stuck in the road.

Directs you where to go.

But a lesson learned in time. 

[Chorus:]
It's something unpredictable,

Wake up, the house is on fire
And the cat's caught in the dryer
Philosophy's a liar when
Your home is your headstone
"Icon" is the last chance for hope
Your faith lied in the ditch that you dug yourself in

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down

Deadbeat holiday – celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over you home

Deadbeat holiday – get on you knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

Christmas lights in the middle of August
Grudges comes back to haunt us
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies
Grounded in a duplex to find that
You're living on a landmine
Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down

Deadbeat holiday – celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over you home

Deadbeat holiday – get on you knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay when all you
Want to do is... Not to...give up
Smell your technicolour in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it like it's so enlightening, staring at the sun that's blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky

Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud

And it goes...

Wearing a psychotic red alert
Your bouquet of flowers in the dirt
Radioactive and primal, Nuclear and so delightful
Wearing day-glo where you know it hurts

Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud

And it goes...

Smell your technicolour in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it like it's so enlightening, staring at the sun that's blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky

Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud

And it goes...
I want to be your dominated love slave
I want to be the one that takes the pain
You can spank me when I do not behave
Smack me in the forehead with a chain

Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive them staples deep

I want you to slap me and call me naughty
Put a beltsander against my skin
I want to feel pain all over my body
Can't wait to be punished for my sins.

Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive them staples deep

Yee-hah!

Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drrrriiiveeee.....Staples?
[Сhorus:]
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy!

Violence is an energy
Against the enemy
Violence is an enemy

Bringing on the fury
the chior infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey

Overthrow the effigy
The vast majority
Burning down the foreman of control

Silience is the enemy
Against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul

[Сhorus:]
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy!

The insurgency will rise!
When the blood's been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies
In your eyes.

Violence is an energy
From here to eternity
Violence is an energy
silence is the enemy
So gimme gimme revolution!

[Сhorus:]
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy!

Overthrow the effigy
The vast majority
Burning down the foreman of control

Silence is the enemy
Against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul


Here we go again, infatuation touches me just when I
Thought that it would end oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but 
I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking

I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that it's not different at all
I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
That's when I say... What the hey!?

Would I last forever? You and I together, hand and hand
We run away -far away-
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can
Give that comes my way -far away-



Going to Pasalacqua

Here we go again, infatuation touches me just when I
Thought that it would end 
Oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking

I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that it's not different at all
I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
That's when I say... What the hey!?

Would I last forever? 
You and I together, hand and hand
We run away -far away-
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can
Give that comes my way -far away-






Hey, little kid
Did you wake up late one day and
You're not so young, but you're still dumb
And you're numb to your old glory but now it's gone

I fell in love, but it didn't catch your fall
Then I crashed into a wall
Then I fell to pieces on the floor
Now you're sick to death

Bombs away, here goes nothing
The shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shouting's over and out
Over and out again

I once was old enough
To know better, man I was too young to care
Many cares, probably would but 
Harvey Wood is dead and gone

You fell in love but then you just fell apart
Like a kick in the head
You're an X-Kid and you never even got started again

Bombs away, here goes nothing
The shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shouting's over and out
Over and out

And you were such a young soul
And you got lost and out of control
You went over the edge of joking
And I have a broken heart

Hey, little kid
Did you wake up late one day and
You're not so young, but you're still dumb
You're an X-Kid and you never even got started again

Bombs away, here goes nothing
The shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shouting's over 
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shouting's over and out
Over and out
Over and over and out


Sittin' on the hood of a camaro
Watchin' shooting stars across the earth
Counting all the bites from the mosquitoes
There goes my Minnesota girl

Lazy days
Gone without notice
In a daze... with faraway eyes

Driving to a closed spot Wednesday afternoon
There goes my Minnesota girl

In a daze
Go without notice
Lazy days....with faraway eyes

Countin' from the pieces we have been through
Here comes my Minnesota girl
There goes my Minnesota girl
There's a trouble in the air
A rumble in the streets
A going out of business sale
And a race to bankruptcy

It's not one to 99, it's 99 to one
A common cause and a call to arms
For the health of our daughters and our sons

It's 99 revolutions tonight [x4]

There's a rat in the company
A bill on easy street
How the fuck did the working stiff
Become so obsolete?

Hit the lights and bang your drum
And let your flag unfold
Cause history will prove itself
In the hall of justice and lost souls

It's 99 revolutions tonight [x4]

We live in troubled times
From the ghettos to an empty suburban home
We live in troubled times
And I'm 99 percent sure that something's wrong

It's 99 revolutions tonight [x8]
Who the hell are you to tell me what I am
  And what's my master plan
  What makes you think that it includes you? 
  Self-righteous wealth
  Stop flattering yourself

So when the smoke clears here I am
  Your reject all-american
  Sucking up you social sect
  Making you a nervous wreck
  To hell and back and hell again I've gone...
  You're not my type, not my type

What's the difference between you and me? 
  I do what I want, and you do what you're told
  So listen up and shut the hell up
  It ain't no big deal
  And I'll see you in hell

So when the smoke clears here I am
  Your reject all-american
  Sucking up you social sect
  Making you a nervous wreck
  To hell and back and hell again I've gone...
  You're not my type, not my type

So when the smoke clears here I am
  Your reject all-american
  Falling from grace, right on my face
  To hell and back and hell again I've gone...


Clenching my teeth tight 
My head is like a sponge 
Give it to me free

I wanna get ripped off 
And drown in the airwaves 
Another fatal wreck 
On the information highway

So go ahead and kill yourselves 
It all amuses me 
For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell 
Another wise ingrate

Bring me blood and pain 
Of a stranger's fate 
Give it all away

Give it to me now

I'm desensitized 
I wanna watch the bomb 
Blow the masses high

I wanna get ripped off 
And drown in the airwaves 
Another fatal wreck 
On the information highway

So go ahead and kill yourselves 
It all amuses me 
For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell 
Another wise ingrate

Bring me blood and pain 
Of a stranger's fate 
Give it all away

I wanna get ripped off 
And drown in the airwaves 
Another fatal wreck 
On the information highway

So go ahead and kill yourselves 
It all amuses me 
For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell 
Another wise ingrate



Starry nights, city lights
Coming down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers
In my head
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
Lost and found city bound in my dreams

And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting...
And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting...

Forget me nots, second thoughts
Live in isolation
Heads or tails and fairytales in my mind
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
The rage and love, the story of my life
The Jesus of suburbia is a lie

And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting...
And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting...unknown
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting...
And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting...unknown
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting...unknown


Maybe I'll see you tonight.
Maybe I'll see you tonight.
Wherever the night takes,
Maybe you'll see me too.

The colder it gets.
You won't see me anymore.
But there's still a chance,
I might walk to your door.

Maybe the timing's not right.
I won't be seeing you tonight.

Maybe I'll see you tonight.
Maybe I'll see you tonight.
Desperate
But not hopeless
I feel so useless
In the murder city
Desperate
But not helpless
The clock strickes midnight
In the murder city

I’m wide awake
After the riot
This demonstration
Of our anguish
This empty laughter
Has no reason
Like a bottle
Of your favorite poison

We are the last call
And we’re so pathetic

Christian’s crying
In the bathroom
And i just want to
Bum a cigarette
We’ve come so far,
we’ve been so wasted
It’s written
All over our faces


Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are these problems just in my mind?
Things are easy when you're a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length I've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead?

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?

Look at my friends and see what they've done
Ask myself why they've had to change
I like them better when they were young
Now all these times are rearranged
I look down and stand there and cry
Nothing ever will be the same
The sun is rising, now I ask why?
The clouds now fall and here comes the rain

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?

Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are these problems just in my mind?
Things are easy when you're a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length I've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead?

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?
She's a rebel
She's a saint
She's assault of the earth
And she's dangerous
She's a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction
From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they
Call 'ol whatsername
She's the symbol
Of resistance
And she's holding on my
Heart like a hand grenade
Is she dreaming
What I'm thinking
Is she the mother of all bombs
Gonna detonate
Is she trouble
Like I'm trouble
Make it a double
Twist of fate
Or a melody that

She sings of revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Well nothing comes to mind

She sings of revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Well nothing comes to mind

She's a rebel
She's a saint
She's assault of the earth
And she's dangerous
She's a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction 

She's a rebel
She's a saint
She's assault of the earth
And she's dangerous
She's a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction

She's a rebel
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
And she's dangerous

She's a rebel
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
And she's dangerous


This time 
I've gotta put my guard down 
And pick myself up off the ground 
And take the pain 

It'll pass 
The swelling never really lasts 
But the scar remains remind me 
That I'm still living 

Well it's not too late 
Girl it's really not worth the fight 
No one's right 
Well it's time to walk away 

Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 

Well the bigger that you call 
All the lying I can't afford 

Walk away 
Walk away 

Did you win? 
Oh baby, did you lose? 
Now you're gonna lick your wounds anyway 
But it comes back to you 

When you fall 
You're gonna need a parachute 
Only a spare of shoes to go 
And walk away 

Well it's not too late 
Girl it's really not worth the fight 
No one's right 
Well it's time to walk away 

Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 

Well the bigger that you call 
All the lying I can't afford 

Walk away 
Walk away 

Walk away 

Eh eh eh eh eh 
Walk away 

Eh eh eh eh eh 
Walk away 

Well the bigger that you call 
All the lying I can't afford 

Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 

Walk away
Hey Gloria? 
Are you standing close to the edge? 
Lookout to the setting sun 
The brink of your vision 
Eternal youth is a landscape of the lies 

The cracks of my skin can prove 
As the years can testify 
Say your prayers and light a fire we're going to start a war 
Your slogan's a gun for hire 
It's what we waited for 

Hey Gloria 
This is why we were on the edge 
The fight of our lives been drawn to this undying love 

Gloria! Viva La Gloria! 
You blast your name in graffiti on the walls (ooohhh) 
Falling through broken glass that's slashing through your spirit 
I can hear it like a jilted crowd 

Gloria! Where are you Gloria? 
You found a home in all your scars and ammunition 
You made your bed in salad days amongst the ruins 
Ashes to ashes of our youth 

She smashed her knuckles into winter (Gloria) 
As autumn's wind fades into black 
She is the saint of all the sinners (Gloria) 
The one that's fallen through the cracks 
So don't put away your burning light 

Gloria! Where are you Gloria? 
Don't lose you faith to your lost naivete 
Weather the storm and don't look back on last November 
When your banners were burning down 

Gloria! Viva La Gloria! 
Send me your amnesty down to the broken hearted 
Bring us the season that we always will remember 
Don't let the bonfires go out 

So Gloria 
Send out your message of the light that shadows in the night 
Gloria where's your undying love? 
Tell me the story of your life ... 
(Your life!) 


My mental stability reaches its bitter end
And all my senses are coming unglued
Is there any cure for this disease someone called love
Not as long as there are girls like you

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I wanna hurt myself

If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall

Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone
And lock myself up in a padded room
I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air
No one wants to hear a drunken fool

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just can't trust myself

If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall

I do not mind if this goes on
Cause now it seems I'm too far gone
I must admit I enjoy myself
80 please keep taking me away

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just can't trust myself

If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall
Today is the first day of the rest
Of our lives
Tomorrow is too late to pretend
Everything's all right
I’m not getting any younger as long
As you don't get any older
I’m not going to state that yesterday never was

Bloodshot deadbeat and a lack of sleep
Making your mascara bleed
Tears down your face
Leaving traces of my mistakes

If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you
And this compromise

I hereby solemnly to tell
The whole truth
And nothing but the truth is what
I'll ever hear from you
«Trust» is a dirty word that comes
Only from such a liar
But «respect» is something I will earn
If you have faith


Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days 
They're getting over the hill 
Death is closing in and catching up 
As far as I can tell 
Got a plan of action and cold blood 
And it smells of defiance 
I'll just wait for Mom and Dad to die 
And get my inheritance 

Now I want more 
'Cause I'm getting bored 
And I'm going nowhere fast 

I was once filled with doubt 
Now it's all figured out 
Nothing good can last 
Crows feet and rot are setting in 

And time is running out 
My parent's income interest rate 
Is gaining higher clout I'm a snot nosed slob 
Without a job 
And I know I damn Well should 

Mom and dad don't look so hot these days 
But my future's looking good


Gonna build it up just to burn it down
You're a princess, I'm a fucking clown
Stop the presses cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine

You're just a fucking kid
And no one ever gives you a break
You want a señorita
And now your heart is gonna break

You're angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Now I'm singing out the alphabet
As the tears are putting out my cigarette

We're at the cemetary so we can see the holiday lights
Waking up the dead and everything'll be alright

You're angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces

Alright
Stuck in the middle of Heaven and Hell
Alright
Trying to find my better angels

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Stop the presses cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine

You're just a fucking kid
And no one ever gives you a break
You want a señorita
And now your heart is gonna break

You're angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces
Walkin' after dark
  In the New York City park
  Your thoughts are so unholy
  In the holiness of old

I haven't got much time so I'll get to the point
You wanna share a ride 
And get the fuck out of this joint
I got an impulse so impulsive that it burns
I wanna break your heart 
Until it makes your stomach churn

I gotta know if you're the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be

So stay, stay the night
Cuz we're runnin' out of time
So stay the night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Stay, stay the night
Cuz we're runnin' out of time
so stay the night
I don't want to say goodbye

I'm just sick and tired of feeling so alone
Well, I don't understand the point if you have to go home
Why won't you stay and cure the circles round my eyes
And we can watch the stars until the sun begins to rise

I gotta know if you're the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be

So stay, stay the night
Cuz we're runnin' out of time
So stay the night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Stay, stay the night
Cuz we're runnin' out of time
so stay the night
I don't want to say goodbye
Come with me and let's go for a ride,
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout,

Cause I know that you're the
Best thing in town, best thing around,
Best thing in town, best thing around.

Running wild and always running free,
Exploring things that I have never seen,
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds.

Now I know that you're the
Best thing in town, best thing around,
Best thing in town, best thing around.

I'm seeing faces
Of mysteries of the earth.
I am not one
To the aggressions of my birth
Or go to stance
Of hallucinations, I can't find
A missing piece
Of a thought that's in my mind.

Come with me and let's go for a ride,
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout,

Cause I know that you're the
Best thing in town, best thing around,
Best thing in town, best thing around.

Running wild and always running free,
Exploring things that I have never seen,
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds.

Now I know that you're the
Best thing in town, best thing around,
Best thing in town, best thing around.
A small cloud has fallen 
The white mist hits the ground 
My lungs comfort me with joy 
Vegging on one detail 
The rest just crowds around 
My eyes itch of burning red 

Pictures sounds 
Of moving insects so surreal 
Lay around 
Looks like I found something new 

Laying in my bed 
I think I'm in left field 
I picture someone, I think it's you 
You're standing so damn close 
My body begins to swell 
Why does one and one make two?

Lights out,
Here comes the night,
As the darkness falls over the light
Lights out,
There goes the day
And this fear that comes won't go away

And I'm losing track of time,
In the corners of my mind
And I'm living out my private suicide 
(lights out)

Lights out
I lost myself
In the space between heaven and hell.
Lights out,
Finding my way,
Did I waste my time losing the way?

And I'm losing track of time
In the corners of my mind,
And I'm living out my private suicide 
(lights out)

Lights out!

Lights out
Here comes the night
As the darkness falls over the light.
Lights out
I lost myself
In the space between heaven and hell

Well I'm losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And I'm living out my private suicide 
(lights out)
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Calling all demons
This is the season
Next stop is therapy

We're the retarded 
And the brokenhearted
The season of misery

Here's to the wasted
I can almost taste it
The rejects and waste of times

Gonna take it further
Get away with murder
And no one here is getting out alive

Here's to all God's losers
Ra da da da de
The bottom-feeder's frenzy

Here's to all bloodsuckers
Sing along with me
Cause we don't say no
Scream one, two, three

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

We're too old to be misbehaved
We sold our souls and so ashamed of ourselves
So we wait for miss judgment day
Write me a letter and send it to my grave

All fucked up beyond intervention
Fuck the world
This is my revolution
Long lost souls and livin' in cages
I'm on a bender
It's one for the ages

I've got the urge 
To binge and surge
The tables turn
To crash and burn

Juliana Homicide
Make my demons come to life
Juliana Homicide
Oh, Won't you be my blushing bride

Chop me a line
Of my best friend's ashes
Dust to dust
When the red Light flashes
What the fuck does "ok" stand for
When the afterlife is nothing worth dying for?

I got the urge 
To binge and surge
The tables turn
To crash and burn

Juliana Homicide
Make my demons come to life
Juliana Homicide
Oh, Won't you be my blushing bride
Alright!

Well California's burning to the ground
And Juliana walks on holy ground
Where there's smoke there's fire
Burning out the lights
'Cause California's burning down tonight
Tonight

Calling all demons
This is the season
Next stop is therapy

We're the retarded 
And the brokenhearted
The season of misery

Here's to the wasted
I can almost taste it
The rejects and waste of times

Gonna take it further
Get away with murder
And no one here is getting out alive

Here's to all God's losers
Ra da da da de
The bottom-feeder's frenzy

Here's to all bloodsuckers
Sing along with me
Cause we don't say no
Scream one, two, three

Hey can you hear me?
I'm calling your name
Hello? Or is this goodbye?
The gleam in your eyes
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again?
So I can rest my head

Angel... Angel! Dancing away
As all of my thoughts get rearranged
Angel... Angel! Turning away
Just when thing seem
To have changed
So I can rest my head

Hey can you hear me?
I'm calling your name
Hello? Or is this goodbye?
The gleam in your eyes
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again?
So I can rest my head



Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Goodbye to the ones that we love

Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love

Violence on the rise
Like a bullet in the sky
Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
Kindred Spirits sing
For the sick and suffering
The city of damage control
This is how we

(Roll... Roll...)

Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the ones in control

Teach our children well
From the bottom of the well
Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
Hear the children sing
For the sick and suffering
The city of damage control
This is how we

Sitting in my room last night
Staring at the mirror
I couldn't find a reason why
I couldn't be near her

'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you'd say

Pictures going through my mind
When we're together
All these long and sleepless nights
Will I ever get better?

'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you'd say
'Cause you are the one I want

Now you know how I feel
This love is forever
You make my life seem so unreal
Will I ever get better? ...

'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you'd say
'Cause you are the one I want
I crossed the river
Fell into the sea
Where the non-believers go beyond belief
Then I scratched the surface
In the mouth of hell
Running out of service in the blood I fell

Well I, I just want to see the light
And I, I don't want to lose my sight
Well I, I just want to see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight

I've been wasted
Pills and alcohol
I've been chasing
Down the pool halls
I drank the water from a hurricane
I set a fire just to see the flame

Well I, I just want to see the light
And I, I don't want to lose my sight
Well I, I just want to see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight

I crossed the desert
Reaching higher ground
Then I found the pavement to take the liars down
But it's gone forever, but never too late
Where the ever after is in the hands of fate

Well I, I just want to see the light
And I, I don't want to lose my sight
Well I, I just want to see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight
- Billy Joe, it's certainly has exciting to meet you here in the recording studio right after you just made your very first record. How does it feel?
- Mmm... Wonderful!

She smashed the radio 
With the board of education 
Turn up the static left 
Of the state, of the nation 

Turn up the flame, step on the gas 
Burning the flag at half mast 
She's a rebel's forgotten son 
An export of the revolution 

She is the first voice 
Of the last ones in the line 
She'll drag the lake 
To keep the vendetta alive 

Bring in the head of the government 
The dog ate the document 
Somebody shot the President 
And no one knows where Maria went? 

Maria, Maria, Maria 
Where did you go? 

Be careful what you're offering 
Your breath lacks the conviction 
Drawing the line in the dirt 
Because the last decision is no, is no

She smashed the radio 
With the board of education

An export of the revolution 

Maria, Maria, Maria

I'm having trouble trying to sleep 
I'm counting sheep but running out 
As time ticks by 
And still I try 
No rest for cross tops in my mind 
On my own... here we go 

My eyes feel like they're going to bleed 
Dried up and bulging out my skull 
My mouth is dry 
My face is numb 
Fucked up and spun out in my room 

On my own... here we go 
My mind is set on overdrive 
The clock is laughing in my face 
A crooked spine 
My sense dulled 
Passed the point of delirium 
On my own... here we go


Hey there lookin' at me
Tell me what do you see
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Don't have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit grey

Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time

What is it that drives me mad
Girls like you that I never had
What is it about you that I adore?
What makes me feel so much pain?
That makes me go so insane
What is it about you that I adore?

Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time

Why did you have to leave so soon?
Why did you have to walk away?
Oh well it happened again
She walked away with her boyfriend
Maybe we'll meet again someday


Don't wanna be an American idiot.
Don't want a nation under the new mania.
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind fuck America.

Welcome to a new kind of tension.
All across the alienation.
Everything isn't meant to be okay.
Television dreams of tomorrow.
We're not the ones who're meant to follow.
For that's enough to argue.

Well maybe I'm the faggot America.
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda.
Now everybody do the propaganda.
And sing along in the age of paranoia.

I lock myself inside my room
I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wanna be alone
Its been disturbed by my thoughts
I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wanna be alone

Please don't think I'm crazy
I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy
To hell with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone
This conflict is my own
Keep your sources away from me
That's all

Staring out of my window
Watching the cars go rolling by
My friends are gone
I've got nothing to do
So I sit here patiently
Watching the clock tick so slowly
Gotta get away
Or my brains will explode

Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

See the hills from afar
Standing on my beat up car
The sun went down and the night fills the sky
Now I feel like me once again
As the train comes rolling in
Smoked my boredom gone
Slapped my brains up so high

Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road

Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road

If there's one thing that I need
That makes me feel complete
So I go to Christie Road
It's home...

Take away the sensation inside
  Bitter sweet migraine in my head
  It's like a throbbing tooth ache of the mind
  I can't take this feeling anymore

[2x:]
Drain the pressure from the swelling,
  This sensation's overwhelming,
  Give me a long kiss goodnight
  And everything will be alright
  Tell me that I won't feel a thing
  So give me Novacaine

Out of body and out of mind
  Kiss the demons out of my dreams
  I get the funny feeling, that's alright
  Jimmy says it's better than air,
  I'll tell you why

Drain the pressure from the swelling,
  This sensation's overwhelming,
  Give me a long kiss goodnight
  And everything will be alright
  Tell me that I won't feel a thing,
  So give me Novacaine

  Oh Novacaine

Drain the pressure from the swelling,
  This sensation's overwhelming,
  Give me a long kiss goodnight
  And everything will be alright
  Tell me Jimmy I won't feel a thing,
  So give me Novacaine


My friend drove off the other day, 
And now he's gone and all they say, 
Is you gotta live cause life goes on 
But now I see I'm mortal too 
I can't live my life like you 
Gotta live it up while life goes on 

And I think it's alright 
That I do what I like 
‘Cause that's the way I wanna live 
And so I give and I'm still giving 

And now I wonder about my friend 
If he gave all he could give 
Cause he lived his life like I live mine 
If you could see inside my head 
Then you'd start to understand 
The things I value in my heart 

You know that, 
I know that, 
You're watching me.

Gotta make a plan
Gotta do what's right
Can't run around in circles if you wanna build a life
And I don't wanna make a plan for a day far away
While I'm young and while I'm able all I wanna do is...
We're living in repetition
Content in the same old shtick again
Now the routine's turning to contention
Like a production line going over and over and over 
Roller coaster

Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
'Cause I love you's not enough
I'm lost for words

Choreographed and lack of passion
Prototypes of what we were
Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous
Taken for granted now
Now I waste it, I faked it, 
I ate it, now I hate it

'Cause I cannot speak, I lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
'Cause I love you's not enough
I'm lost for words, now I cannot speak

Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
'Cause I love you's not enough
I'm lost for words


I'm on a sentimental journey
Into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down.
A conscientious objector to the
War that's in my mind
While leaving in the lurch and I'm
Taking back what's mine.

I'm on a mission
Into destination unknown,
An expedition
Into desolation road
Where I'm a...

Castaway, going at it alone,
Castaway, now I'm on my own,
Castaway, going at it alone,
Castaway, now I'm on my own,
Lost and found, trouble bound,
Castaway...

I'm riding on the night train and
Driving stolen cars
Testing my nerves out of the boulevard.
Spontaneous combustion in the
Corners of my mind
While leaving in the lurch
And I'm taking back what's mine.

I'm on a mission
Into destination unknown,
An expedition
Into desolation road
Where I'm a...

Castaway, going at it alone,
Castaway, now I'm on my own,
Castaway, going at it alone,
Castaway, now I'm on my own,
Lost and found, trouble bound,
Castaway...

I'm on a sentimental journey
Into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down.
A conscientious objector to the
War that's in my mind
While leaving in the lurch and I'm
Taking back what's mine.

I'm on a mission

Castaway, now I'm on my own,
Castaway, going at it alone,

Castaway,
Castaway,
Castaway (castaway),
Castaway (castaway)...
Thought I ran into you down on the street,
  Then it turned out to only be a dream.
  I made a point to burn all of her photographs,
  She went away and then I took a different path.
  I remember the face,
  But I can't recall the name,
  Now I wonder how Whatsername has been.

Seems that she disappeared without a trace.
  Did she ever marry 'ol Whatshisface. 
  I made a point to burn all of the photographs,
  She went away and then I took a different path.
  I remember the face,
  But I can't recall the name,
  Now I wonder how Whatsername has been. 

Remember, whatever,
  It seems like forever ago.
  Remember, whatever,
  It seems like forever ago.

The regrets are useless in my mind,
  She's in my head,
  I must confess.
  The regrets are useless in my mind,
  She's in my head,
  From so long ago
  Go go go

And in the darkest night,
  If my memory serves me right
  I'll never turn back time,
  Forgetting you, but not the time...


Say hello from your window 
Say goodbye from your car 
Say goodnight from your pillow 
Say so long from the stars

Stay out of my, out of my life
Sing to me a lullaby
Cradle songs from a new life
Don't forget to pass me by

My imagination runs away
On this 8th avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the Whispering Wall
Before all the flames burn out

My imagination runs away
On this 8th avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the Whispering Wall
Before all the flames burn out



[Verse 1:]
Life after youth
Faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love
First forgiveness
We were delinquеnts
Freaks of a faded memory

[Chorus:]
Outlaws,
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever, baby

[Verse 2:]
Scars, broken hearts
Breaking in cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls
Bottle rockets
All that we wanted
It's for our lives beyond stars

[Chorus:]
Outlaws,
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever, baby

[Bridge]
I've got no supervision
Nothing will change my spirits
Race around with my innocence
I'll plead my innocence
But that's my best defense
When you are young

[Chorus:]
Outlaws,
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws all forever

[Outro:]
I found a knife by the railroad track
You took a train and you can't go back
Forever now, forever now you'll roam, roam, roam, roam...



Well, I've got a fever
A non-believer
I'm in a state of grace
For I am the Caesar
Peacemaker
I'm gonna seize the day
Well, call of the banshee hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
As God as my witness 
The infidels are gonna pay

Well, call the assassin
The orgasm
A spasm of love and hate
For what will divide us?
The righteous and the meek
Well, call of the wild hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
Death to the girl at the end of the serenade

Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire 
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite

I am a killjoy from Detroit
I drink from a well of rage
I feed off the weakness with all my love
Call up the captain hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
Death to the lover that you were dreaming of

This is a stand off
A Molotov cocktail
On the house
You thought I was a write off
You better think again
Call the peacemaker hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
I'm gonna send you back to the place where it all began

Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite

Well now the caretaker's the undertaker
Now I'm gonna go out and get the peacemaker
This is the neo St. Valentines Massacre
Well call up the Gaza hey hey
hey hey hey hey hey
Death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade


I'll go for miles
  Till I find you
  You say you want to leave me
  But you can't choose
  I've gone through pain
  Every day and night
  I feel my mind is going insane
  Something I can't fight

Don't leave me (2x)

A blank expression
  Covering your face
  I'm looking for directions
  For out of this place
  I start to wonder
  If you'll come back
  I feel the rain storming after thunder
  I can't hold back

Don't leave me (4x)

I'll go for miles
  Till I find you
  You say you want to leave me
  But you can't choose
  I've gone through pain
  Every day and night
  I feel my mind is going insane
  Something I can't fight

Don't leave me (4x)


See a young girl so soft and blonde
  Doesn't attack me, but she did once
  Intoxication's in her veins
  Sweet young boy plays with her brain

Lydia'll bring to life
  What are your chance not to oblige?
  Putting his hand on her thigh
  Ability has now been ripped
  Take it away, I'd rather sit

Sweet children
  Sweet children
  Sweet children
  Remember when

Johnny's playing fun and games
  Or else he's in the storage shed
  Running from the light of day
  Or maybe lie and celebrate

The funny circus from his head
  Follow me, if you understand
  I'll trick her so she'll do it
  Then I'll sing and now we run

Sweet children
  Sweet children
  Sweet children
  Remember when

Sweet children
  Sweet children
  Sweet children
  Remember when


Oh, love, 
Oh, love,
Won't you rain on me tonight? 
Oh, life, 
Oh, life, 
Please don't pass me by. 
Don't stop, 
Don't stop, 
Don't stop when the red lights flash. 
Oh, ride, 
Free ride, 
Won't you take me close to you? 

Far away, 
Far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
I'm wearing my heart on a noose. 
Far away, 
Far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
Tonight my heart's on the loose. 

Oh, lights 
And action, 
I just can't be satisfied. 
Oh, losers 
And choosers, 
Won't you please hold on my life? 
Oh, hours 
And hours, 
Like the dog years of the day. 
Old story, 
Same old story, 
Won't you see the lights of day? 

Far away, 
Far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
I'm wearing my heart on a noose. 
Far away, 
Far away,
Waste away tonight, 
Tonight my heart's on the loose. 

Talk myself out of feeling, 
Talk my way out of control, 
Talk myself out of falling in love, 
Falling in love with you. 

Oh, love, 
Oh, love, 
Won't you rain on me tonight? 
Oh, ride, 
Free ride, 
Won't you take me close to you? 

Far away, 
Far away, 
Waste away tonight,
I'm wearing my heart on a noose. 
Far away, 
Far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
Tonight my heart's on the loose. [x2]

Tonight my heart's on the loose, 
Tonight my heart's on the loose.
What brings you around? 
Did you lose something the last time you were here? 
You'll never find it now 

It's buried deep with your identity 
so stand aside and let the next one pass 
Don't let the door kick you in the ass 

There's no return from 86 
Don't even try 

Exit out the back 
And never show your head around again 
Purchase your ticket and 
Quickly take the last train 
Out of town


I text a postcard, send to you...
Did it go through?
Sending all my love to you.

As I stepped to the edge
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
With my conscience beating
Like the pulse of a drum
That hammers on and on
Until I reach the break of day
As the sun beats down on
The halfway house
Has my conscience beating
The sound in my ear
The will to persevere
As I reach the break of day

[Chorus:]
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskated and the losers
Nothing's left to cling onto
Gotta to hold on
You got to hold on to yourself

A cry of hope
A plea for peace
And my conscience beating
It's not what I want for
It's all that I need
To reach the break of day
So I run to the edge
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
With my conscience bleeding
Here lies the truth the lost treasures of my youth
As I hold on to the break of day

[Chorus:]
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskated and the losers
Nothing's left to cling on
Gotta to hold on 
Hold on to yourself

Take it up

(instrumental break)

[Chorus:]
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskated and the losers
Nothing's left to cling on
You got to hold on
Gotta to hold on
Hold on, hold on to yourself 


Breaking in a sweat
  Like a bomb threat
  Is your silhouette fading out?
  Nothing left to lose
  Detonate the fuse
  Another breaking news blowout

Ain't it beautiful?
  So unusual
  Life's a gas and it's running out
  Living a cliche
  Gonna seize the day
  Bottle rockets and celebrate, celebrate, celebrate

Carpe diem, a battle cry
  Are we all too young to die?
  Ask a reason and no reply
  Are we all too young to die?

Making a living
  Making a killing
  What's worth forgiving?
  Alright

The blink of an eye
  Barely scraping by
  Dominated by passer by's
  Feeling out of luck
  When the traffic's stuck
  And you're feeling
  So left behind

Getting off a binge
  Get a second wind
  Another promise
  Just make a change
  Got a Broken wing
  Hear the angels sing
  With a signal that's out of range
  Ain't it strange?
  Ain't it strange?

Carpe diem, a battle cry
  Are we all too young to die?
  Ask a reason and no reply
  Are we all too young to die?

Making a living
  Making a killing
  What's worth forgiving?
  Alright

I'm all busted up
Broken bones and nasty cuts
Accidents will happen
But this time I can't get up
She comes to check on me
Making sure I'm on my knees
After all she's the one
Who put me in this state

Is she ultra-violent?
Is she disturbed?
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh god, she's killing me!!!

For now I'll lie around
hell, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true

Is she ultra-violent?
Is she disturbed?
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh god, she's killing me!!!

Looking out my window for
Someone that's passing by
No one knows I'm locked in here
All I do is cry

For now I'll lie around
hell, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true
I fucked up again it's all my fault. 
So turn me around and face the wall. 
Read me my rights and tell me I'm wrong
Until it gets into my thick skull. 

A slap on the wrist, a stab in the back. 
Torture me, I've been a bad boy. 
Nail me to the cross until you have won. 
I lost before I did any wrong. 

I'm hexed with regrets and bad luck. 
Keep you distance 'cause it's rubbing off. 
Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell. 
Or earth with me tangled at your feet. 
You finally met your nemesis
Disguised as your fatal long lost love. 
So kiss it good bye 
Until death do we part. 
You fell for a jinx for crying out loud.

I'm a curse hanging around you! [x4]
Now you see me, now you don't,
Don't ask me where I'm at,
'Cause I'm a million miles away
Treated like a forbidden heel.
Don't say my thoughts are not for real
Or you won't see me again.

Am I here or am I there?
Or am I playing on the stairs?
Am I in my room with my toys?
I am the disappearing boy.

When I walk in crowded rooms,
I feel as if it is my doom.
I know that I don't belong.
In that room I see her,
I see her, and she's with him,
I turn and then I'm gone.

Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home,
My whereabouts are now unknown.
I vanished from all your joy,
I'm the disappearing boy.

I have my doubts
Of where I belong.
It's something to think about.

Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home,
My whereabouts are now unknown.
I vanished from all your joy,
I'm the disappearing boy.
Today's the Macy's Day Parade
  The night of the living dead is on its way
  With a credit report for duty call
  It's a lifetime guarantee
  Stuffed in a coffin 10% more free
  Red light special at the mausoleum

Give me something that I need
  Satisfaction guaranteed to you
  What's the consolation prize?
  Economy sized dreams of hope

When I was a kid I thought
  I wanted all the things that I haven't got
  Oh I learned the hardest way
  Then I realized what it took
  To tell the difference between
  Thieves and crooks
  A lesson learned to me and you

Give me something that I need
  Satisfaction guaranteed
  Because I'm thinking about
  A brand new hope
  The one I've never known
  Cause now I know
  It's all that I wanted

What's the consolation prize?
  Economy sized dreams of hope
  Give me something that I need
  Satisfaction guaranteed
  Because I'm thinking about
  A brand new hope
  The one I've never known
  And where it goes
  And I'm thinking about
  The only road
  The one I've never known
  And where it goes

And I'm thinking about
  A brand new hope
  The one I've never known
  Cause now I know
  It's all that I wanted






Words get trapped in my mind
Sorry I don't take the time to feel the way I do
‘Cause the first day you came into my life
When time ticks around you

But then I need your voice
As a key to unlock all the love
That's trapped in me
So tell me when it's time
To say I love you

[x2:]
All I want is you to understand
That when I take your hand
It's ‘cause I want to
We are all born in a world of doubt
But there's no doubt
I've figured out I love you

And I've been alone before
All the losers that will never take the time to say
What's really on their mind
Instead they just hide away
And yet they'll never have
Someone like you to grab their hand

And help along the way
Or tell them when it's time
To say I love you
So tell me when it's time
To say I love you
Something's on my mind
It's been for quite some time
This time I'm on to you
So where's the other face?
The face I heard before
Your head trip's boring me

Let's nuke the bridge we torched
2,000 times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say

Stuck down in a rut of dislogic and smut
A side of you well hid
When it's all said and done
it's real and it's been fun
But was it all REAL fun

Let's nuke the bridge we torched
2,000 times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've felt this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say to say...

You're just... a fuck,
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck.
I'm take-in pride
in telling you to fuck off and die.

I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say
I'm taking pleasure in the doubts I've passed to you
So listen up as you bite thisssss...

You're just... a fuck,
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck.
I'm take-in pride
in telling you to fuck off and die.

Goood niiiiiiiiight....

[Verse 1:]
I'm running late to somewhere now I don't want to be
Where the future and promises ain't what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side ever get so dull?

[Chorus 1:]
All grown up and medicated
I'm high on cellular waves
I put the "riot" in patriot
And we all die in threes

[Verse 2:]
I got a scene in the middle of the road
I'm gonna take my time
I shop online so I can bolt
At the speed of life
I'm like a drone way up in the sky
I'm a shooting star
There's a soldier that's freaking out
P.S. this is war

[Chorus 2:]
All grown up and medicated
I'm high on cellular waves
I put the "riot" in patriot
And we all die in threes
All we want is money and guns
A new catastrophe
Here goes nothing, there's nothing to lose
It's a small price we pay
When we all die in threes

[Bridge: 6x]
Somewhere now

[Outro:]
Hallelujah! I found my soul
Under the sofa pillows
Congratulations, I found myself
Somewhere now [3x]




What good is love and peace on earth? 
When it's exclusive? 
Where's the truth in the written word? 
If no one reads it 
A new day dawning 
Comes without warning 
So don't blink twice 

We live in troubled times 
We live in troubled times 

What part of history we learned 
When it's repeated 
Some things will never overcome 
If we don't seek it 
The world stops turning 
Paradise burning 
So don't think twice 

We live in troubled times 
We live in troubled times 
We live in troubled times 

We run for cover 
Like a skyscraper's falling down 
Then I wander like a troubled mind 

What good is love and peace on earth? 
When it's exclusive 
Where's the truth in the written word? 
If no one reads it 
A new day dawning 
Comes without warning 
So don't look twice 

We live in troubled times [6x]
Wherever you go
You know I'll be there
If you go far,
You know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere,
So I'll see you there
You place the name
You know I'll be there
You name the time
You know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there

I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
I'll be there for you

Where there's truth
You know I'll be there
Amongst the lies
You know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there

I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
I'll be there for you

If you should fall
You know I'll be there
To catch the call
You know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there

I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
I don't care
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
[Verse 1:]
Concrete dream
I'm gonna make a scene
Radio
Covered in gasoline
Sleeping in reverse 
And everybody's bouncing off the walls

[Verse 2:]
Bombs away
It's just another day
Of idle threats
The secret alphabet
And I wouldn't sweat it
And everybody's bouncing off the walls
(I'm bouncing off the walls!)

Alright

[Verse 3:]
Concrete kiss
Come on and do the twist
The Radio, my little exorcist
We're all getting pissed
And everybody's bouncing off the walls

[2x:]
'Cause it's all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks
And we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeros




He hit the ground running,
At the speed of light
The star was brightly shining,
Like a neon light

It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son

A fixture on the talkshows,
To the silver screen
From here to Colorado,
He's a sex machine

It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son

But isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
It's pretty bloody sad,
But isn't it a drag?

A clean-cut All-American,
Really ain't so clean
His royal auditorium,
Is a murder scene

It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son

Oh, isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
It's pretty bloody sad,
But isn't it a drag?

Well no one says it's fair
Turn a teenage lush,
To a millionaire

Now where's your fuckin' champion?
On a bed you laid
He's not the All-American,
That you thought you paid

It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son

But isn't it a drag?
Hey old man in woman's shoes
I wonder I he knows I think he's crazy
When he was young 
Did he have dreams of wearing woman's shoes and being crazy

It makes me wonder when I grow that age
Will I be walking down the street
Begging for your spare change

Or will I ever grow that old?
Will I still be around?
The way I carry on I'll end up
six feet underground and waste away....

When the old man was in school
Did the ‘golden rules' make him go crazy
Or did he hide away from hopes
Behind a smile and smoking dope
It's crazy

It makes me wonder when I grow that age
Will I be walking down the street
Begging for your spare change

Or will I ever grow that old?
Will I still be around?
The way I carry on I'll end up
six feet underground and waste away....

It seems so frightning
Time passes my like lightning
Before you know it you're struck down
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around.


I've been waiting a long time 
For this moment to come 
I'm destined 
For anything... at all 
Downtown lights will be shining 
On me like a diamond 
Ring out under the midnight hour 
No one can touch me now 
And I can't turn my back 
It's too late ready or not at all 

I'm so much closer than 
I have ever known... 
Wake up 

Dawning of a new era 
Calling... don't let it catch you falling 
Ready or not at all 
So close enough to taste it 
Almost... I can embrace this 
Feeling... on the tip of my tongue 

I'm so much closer than 
I have ever known... 
Wake up 
Better thank your lucky stars... 

I've been waiting a lifetime 
For this moment to come 
I'm destined for anything at all 

Dumbstruck 
Colour me stupid 
Good luck 
You're gonna need it 
Where I'm going if I get there... 
At all... 

Wake up 
Better thank your lucky stars...
Amy 
Is your heart singing out of tune 
Are your eyes just singing the blues 
Dirty records from another time 
Some blood stains on your shoes 
No one really knows about your soul 
And I barely even know your name 
Burning rhythms and posting lies 
For a bunch of fools drown in shame 
Amy don't you go 
I want you around 
Singin' woah please don't go 
Do you wanna be a friend of mine? 
Did you tattoo a lucky charm 
To keep you out of harms way? 
Warding off all evil signs 
But it never really kept you safe 
You're too young for the golden age 
Cause the record bin's been replaced 
27 gone without a trace 

And you walked away from your drink 
Is your heart singing out of tune 
Are you eyes just singing the blues? 
Dirty records from another time 
Some blood stains on your shoes 
May I have this last dance 
By chance if we should meet? 
Can you write me a lullaby? 
So we can sing you to sleep
[Verse 1:]
Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much,
And I don't give a fuck anyway.
You always seem to be stepping in shit,
And all you really do is complain.
Hitch a ride, tell 'em all you like,
Small minds tend to think alike.
Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much,
And I don't give a fuck anyway.

[Chorus:]
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go! [x4]
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go! [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Cut the crap 'cause you're screaming in my ear,
And you're talking up all of my space,
You're thinning my patience again,
And I'd rather get punched in the face.
You're getting on my every last nerve,
Everything you've said I've already heard.
I'm sick to death of your every last breath,
And I don't give a fuck anyway.

[Chorus:]
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go! [x4]
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go! [x4]

(Guitar Solo)

Everyone is fucking with my head now! 
Don't stop fucking with my head now!
You're fucking with my fucking head now!
You're the every thing I can't stand!

[Chorus:]
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go! [x4]
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go! [x4]
Bring me back to an hour ago
Time stands still as the years go by
Brown eyed girl that's throwing down a bottle of Olde English
Back in the warehouse

Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
Kids alright, alright as they'll ever be

'Cause you will always be my
Well you will always by my
You will always be my sweet sixteen

Sleep on the floor on cardboard
Stab out my heart like a dart board
Browned skinned girl I had a dream about a long, long time now
From the midwest to the beach

Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
Kids alright, alright as they'll ever be

'Cause you will always be my
Well you will always by my
You will always be my sweet sixteen

Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
Kids alright, alright as they'll ever be

'Cause you will always be my
Well you will always by my
You will always be my sweet sixteen



He's a victim of his own time 
In his vintage suit and tie 
He's casualty dressed to the teeth 
In the latest genocide 
The new seasons come and go 
At the dog and pony show 
Gonna sit and beg and fetch the names 
And fallow the dress codes 
What’s in a name?...HEY! 
She's a scented magazine 
Looking sharp and leaving clean 
Living well and dressed to kill 
But she looks like hell to me 
So when you're dancing throgh your wardrope 
Do the anorex - a go-go 
Cloaked with style for pedophiles 
As the credit card explodes 
You auctioned off your life 
For the most expensive price 
Going once... 
Going twice... 
Now it's gone 
What's in a name, hey? 
What's in a name, hey? 
Say, hey!


I'm not fucking around
I think I'm coming out
All the deceivers and cheaters
I've think we've got a bleeder right now
Want you to slap me around
Want you to knock me out
Well, you missed me kissed me
Now you better kick me down

Maybe you're the runner up
But the first one to lose the race
Almost only really counts in
Horseshoes and hand grenades

I'm gonna burn it all down
I'm gonna rip it out
Well, everything that you employ
Was meant for me to destroy
To the ground now
So don't you fuck me around
Because I'll shoot you down
I'm gonna drink, fight and fuck
And pushing my luck
All the time now

Maybe you're the runner up
But the first one to lose the race
Almost only really counts in
Horseshoes and hand grenades

Demolition, self-destruction
What to annihilate
The age-old contradiction
Demolition, self-destruction
What to annihilate
The old age

I'm not fucking around
I think I'm coming out
All the deceivers and cheaters
I've think we've got a bleeder right now
I'm not fucking around
G-L-O-R-I-A


She is my drama queen
  She is so wild and reckless
  She is my drama queen

She dangles from her necklace
  Daddy's little bundle of joy
  Out of a magazine
  Everyone's drama queen
  Is old enough to bleed now

She is my drama queen
  Her life is now unfolding
  There goes my drama queen
  What do you think she's holding?

Aye little drama queen
  How did you find your savior?
  Oh little drama queen
  You better call a lawyer

Daddy's little bundle of joy
  Out of a magazine
  Everyone's drama queen
  Is old enough to bleed now

Aye little drama queen
  From here to San Francisco
  Everyone’s drama queen
  I think she's going psycho

Daddy's little bundle of joy
  Out of a magazine
  Everyone's drama queen
  Is old enough to bleed now

She's old enough to bleed now
  She's old enough to bleed now




[Chorus:]
Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
She's my little youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Punch-drunken youngblood

She's a loner, not a stoner
Bleeding heart and the soul of Miss Teresa
Supernova, Cherry Cola
She's the cedar in the trees of Minnesota

I'm a rough boy 'round the edges
Getting drunk, and fallen in the hedges
She's my weakness, fucking genius
Swear to god and I'm not even superstitious

[Chorus:]
Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
She's my little youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Punch-drunken youngblood

I want to hold you like a gun
We'll shoot the moon into the sun
Alright, alright

Are you stranded, like I'm stranded?
Do you want to watch the world fall to pieces?
Are you broken, like I'm broken?
Are you restless? She said: "Fuck you, I'm from Oakland!"

[Chorus:]
Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
She's my little youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Punch-drunken youngblood





Nobody likes you...
Everyone left you...
They're all out without you...
Having fun...

Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collecting unemployment checks
Like a flunky along for a ride
Where have all the riots gone
As your city's model gets pulverized?
What's in love is now in debt
On your birth certificate
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse!

The town bishop is an extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Standing still when it's do or die
You better run for your fucking life

Chorus:
It's not over 'till your underground
It's not over before it's too late
It's cities burnin', it's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late

There's nothing left to analyze

Where will all the martyrs go
When the virus cures itself?
And where will we all go
When it's too late?

And don't look back

You're not the Jesus of Suburbia
The St. Jimmy is a figment of
Your father's rage and your mother's love
Made me the idiot America

Chorus...

She said I can't take this place
I'm leaving it behind
Well she said I can't take this town
I'm leaving you tonight


[Verse 1:]
I woke up to a bitter storm (bitter year)
And Noah's Ark came washed up on the shore
The riot gear has lined the dawn (bitter year)
Like dogs that shit on your neighbor's lawn

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade
Let them eat poison and it tastes like lemonade

[Chorus:]
Back in the USA for a small town serenade
With fireworks on display
Tonight, it's a hero's welcome home
And there's no place else to go
And I'm takin' it to the grave
Back in the USA

[Verse 2:]
The saddest story ever told (bitter year)
Is feeling safe in our suburban homes
Like soldiers of an endless war (bitter year)
And every church can have a liquor store

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade
Let them eat poison and it tastes like lemonade

[Chorus:]
Back in the USA for a small town serenade
With fireworks on display
Tonight, it's a hero's welcome home
And there's no place else to go
And I'm takin' it to the grave
Back in the USA
All the time
Every time I need it
What's the time?
I'd say the time is right,
Here's to me
Let's find another reason
Down the hatch and a bad attitude
Salut!

Wastin' time
Wastin' time
Down a bum fuck road,
And I don't know where the hell it'll go,
Heirlooms,
Huffing fumes
And I'm pickin' up the pace
And I'm gonna smash straight into a wall

All the time
New Year's resolutions,
How soon that we forget?
Doin' time
Lovin' every minute,
Live it up on another let down
Salut!

Promises
Promises
It was all set in stone,
Cross my heart and I hope to die,
Sugar fix,
Dirty tricks
And a trick question
Guess I should have read between the lines

Havin' the time of my life,
Watchin' the clock tick
Havin' the time of my life,
Watchin' the clock tick

All the time
Where did all the time go?
It's too late to say good night,
Time flies
When you're havin' fun yeah,
Time's up when you work like a dog
Salut!



I'm talking all you down with me
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothing's gonna change my mind
I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothing left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway

Well no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times we've spent and what they've been
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing

I'm losing all my happiness
The happiness you pinned on me
My loneliness still comforts me
My anger dwells inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you
And all that shit you put me through

Well no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times we've spent and what they've been
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing

Do you ever think back to another time?
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
And mow down any bullshit that confronts you?
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head
To make one problem that adds up to nothing?
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing



Now it seems I can't keep my mind of you
My brain drifts back to better days we've been through
Like sitting on blacktop of the school grounds
The love I witched about I finally found

But now it's gone and I take the blame
So there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?

Now I dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me... I am blind without a cause
And now I realized what I have lost

It was something real that I could have had
Now I play the fool whose stable soul's gone bad
Why?

Tell me the words I might have said
That's pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late?
Just tell me the words I might have ate

But now it's gone and I take the blame
So there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?
This whiskey sour, amateur hour,
Raise your glass and toast your friends,
Someday we will fight again.
Well, your enemies, your tragedies,
Pocket knives and rusty chains,
Where, the hell, is the old gang at?

And all the losers can't even win for losing,
And the beginners don't even know what song they're singing.

When there's no one left around,
And you're the last gang in town,
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound. [x2]

This broken scene is turning green,
A brass knuckles left in the rain.
Death wish kids among the living.
I wanna ride on the divided,
Anything but the mainstream.
Where, the f*ck, is your old gang man?

And all the losers, can't even win for losing,
And the beginners don't even know what song they're singing.

When there's no one left around,
And you're the last gang in town,
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound. [x2]

So long!
Didn't even say goodnight.
So long,
There's nowhere to go when you're hiding in plain sight...

When there's no one left around,
And you're the last gang in town,
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound. [x4]

Roaming 'round your house
Wasting your time
No obligation,just
Wasting your time
So why are you alone?
Wasting your time
When you could be with me
Wasting your time

Well, I'm a waste like you
With nothing else to do
May I waste your time too?

Warding off regrets
Wasting your time
Smoking cigarettes
Wasting your time
I'm just a parasite
Wasting your time

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin
Of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one

I cried to my daddy on the telephone “how long now?” 
“Until the clouds unroll and you come down,” The line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent

A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief, how long now
Until a weather change condemns belief, how long now
When the night watchman lets in the thief, what's wrong now

I've got a really bad disease 
It's got me begging 
On my hands and knees 
So, take me to the emergency 
'Cause something seems to be missing 
Somebody take the pain away 
It's like an ulcer bleeding in my brain 
So, send me to the pharmacy 
So I can lose my memory 

I'm elated 
Medicated 
Lord knows I tried to find a way to run away. 

I think they found another cure 
For broken hearts and feeling insecure 
You'd be surprised what I endure 
What make you feel so self-assured? 

I need to find a place to hide 
You never know what could be 
Waiting outside 
The accidents that you could find 
It's like some kind of suicide 

So what ails you is what impales you 
I feel like I've been crucified 
To be satisfied 

I'm a victim of my symptom 
I am my own worst enemy 
You're a victim of your symptom 
You are your own worst enemy 
Know your enemy 

I'm elated 
Medicated 
I am my own worst enemy 
So what ails you is what impales you 
You are your own worst enemy 
You're a victim of the system 
You are your own worst enemy 
You're a victim of the system 
You are your own worst enemy

I woke up in a pool of sweat
First I thought that I pissed the bed
Haunted stories in the midnight hour
The kiss of death from the Eiffel Tower

And I went down like the speed of sound
You're out of sight but not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck 
And I fell for you

I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while
I'll crash into you, I crash into you
'Cause you crash in my imagination too

Break a leg and you crush my heart
I'm a mess and you're a work of art
Count your blessings going zero to five
Steal a kiss and I took a dive

And I went down like the speed of sound
You're out of sight but not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips 
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck 
And I fell for you

I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while
I'll crash into you, I crash into you
'Cause you crash in my imagination

I had a dream that I kissed your lips 
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck 
And I fell for you

And I fell for you
And I fell for you
She...
  She screams in silence
  A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
  Waiting for a sign
  To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world
  That's been planned out for you?
  Are you feeling like a social tool 
  Without a use?
  Scream at me until my ears bleed
  I'm taking heed just for you

She...
  She's figured out
  All her doubts were someone else's point of view
  Waking up this time
  To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world
  That's been planned out for you?
  Are you feeling like a social tool 
  Without a use?
  Scream at me until my ears bleed
  I'm taking heed just for you

EHHHHHH, aHHHHHHHHHH!!!

Are you locked up in a world
  That's been planned out for you?
  Are you feeling like a social tool 
  Without a use?
  Scream at me until my ears bleed
  I'm taking heed just for you


[Part I. Mass Hysteria]

Sing us the song of the century
That sings like American eulogy,
The dawn of my love and conspiracy,
Of forgotten hope and the class of 13.
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me.

Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!

Red alert is the color of panic,
Elevated to the point of static.
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics
And the neighborhood's a loaded gun.
Idle thought leads to full-throttle screaming
And the welfare is asphyxiating.
Mass confusion is all the new rage,
And it's creating a feeding ground
For the bottom feeders of hysteria.

Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!

True sounds of maniacal laughter
And the deaf-mute is misleading the choir.
The punchline is a natural disaster
And it's sung by the unemployed.
Fight fire with a riot.
The class war is hanging on a wire
Because the martyr is a compulsive liar when he said:
"It's just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the hysteria"

Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!

There's a disturbance on the oceanside
They tapped into the reserve.
The static response is so unclear now
Mayday, this is not a test!
As the neighborhood burns, America is falling!
Vigilantes warning you сalling Christian and Gloria

[Part II. Modern World]

I don't want to live in the modern world!
I don't want to live in the modern world!
I don't want to live in the modern world!
I don't want to live in the modern world!

I'm the class of 13
In the era of dissent,
A hostage of the soul.
On a strike to pay the rent.
The last of the rebels.
Without a common ground.
I'm gonna light a fire
Into the underground.

I don't want to live in the modern world!
I don't want to live in the modern world!
I don't want to live in the modern world!
I don't want to live in the modern world!

I am a nation
Without bureaucratic ties
Deny the allegation as it's written

I want to take a ride to the great divide
Beyond the "up to date".
And the neo-gentrified
The high definition for the low resident.
Where the value of your mind
Is not held in contempt.
I can hear the sound of
A beating heart
That bleeds beyond a system,
That's falling apart,
With money to burn
On minimum wage.
Cause I don't give a shit
About the modern age.

I don't want to live in the modern world!
I don't want to live in the modern world!
I don't want to live in the modern world!
I don't want to live in the modern world!
I don't want to live in the modern world!
Mass hysteria!
I don't want to live in the modern world!
Mass hysteria!
I don't want to live in the modern world!
Mass hysteria!
I don't want to live in the modern world!
Mass hysteria!











I heard you crying loud,
  All the way across town
  You've been searching for that someone,
  And it's me out on the prowl
  As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
  Well, don't get lonely now
  And dry your whining eyes
  I'm just roaming for the moment
  Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight
  you been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
  Cause you know where I'll be found
  When I come around

I heard it all before
  So don't knock down my door
  I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
  to try and slag me down because I know you're right
  So go do what you like
  Make sure you do it wise
  You may find out that your self-doubt means 
  Nothing was ever there

You can't go forcing something 
  If it's just not right

No time to search the world around
  Cause you know where I'll be found
  When I come around
  When I come around

No time to search the world around
  Cause you know where I'll be found
  When I come around
  When I come around
  When I come around
  When I come around


I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we shared
Makes me wish that you were here
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
All the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes

Open the past and present
Now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present
And the future too
It's all I've got and I'm giving it up to you

Loose ends tied in knots
Leaving a lump down in my throat
Gagging on a souvenir
Lodged to fill another year
Drag it on and on 
Until my skin is ripped to shreds
Leaving myself wide open
Living out a sacrifice

Open the past and present
Now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present
And the future too
It's all I've got and I'm giving it up to you

If you got no one!
And I've got no place to go!
Would it be alright? 
Could it be alright?

I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we shared
Makes me wish that you were here
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
All the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes

Open the past and present
Now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present
And the future too
It's all I've got and I'm giving it up to you
It's all I've got and I'm giving it up to you
Little girl, little girl
Why are you crying?
Inside your restless soul your heart is dying.
Little one, little one
Your soul is purging
Of love and razor blades
Your blood is surging

Runaway
From the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
Your a stray for the salvation army
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go

Little girl, little girl
Your life is calling
The charlatans and saints of your abandon
Little one little one
The sky is falling
The lifeboat of deception is now sailing
In the wake all the way
No rhyme or reason
Your bloodshot eyes
Will show your heart of treason
Little girl little girl
You dirty liar
You're just a junkie
Preaching to the choir

Runaway
To your lost tranquility
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the dregs of humanity
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go

The traces of blood
Always follow you home
Like the mascara tears
From your getaway
Your walking with blisters
and running with shears
So unholy.
Sister of grace.

Runaway
From the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the salvation army
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go


[Part 1 - The death of St. Jimmy:]
My heart is beating from me
I am standing all alone
Please call me only if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live
In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
The fixture in the city of lust
What the hell's your name?
What's your pleasure and whats your pain?
Do you dream to much?
Do you think what you need is a crutch?
In the crowd of pain. St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says 'we're fucked up'
But we're not the same
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame

Jimmy died today

He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind it's my own private suicide

[Part 2 - East 12th St.:]
Well nobody cares
Well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?

Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on east 12th st.
He's not listened to a word now
He's in his own world
And he's daydreaming

He'd rather be doing something else now,
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly,
His life's on the line with anxiety now,
And she had enough,
And he had plenty

Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

So far away
I don't want to stay
Get me out of here right now
I just wanna be free
Is there a possibility?
Get me out of here right now
This life like dream ain't for me

[Part 3 - Nobody likes you:]
I fell asleep while watching spike TV
After 10 cups of coffee
And you're still not here
Dreaming of a song
But something went wrong
But I can't tell anyone
'Cause no one's here
Left me here alone
And I should have stayed home
After 10 cups of coffee I'm thinking
(where'd you go?)
Nobody likes you, everyone left you
(where'd you go?)
They're all out without you havin' fun
(where'd you go?)
Everyone left you, nobody likes you
(where'd you go?)
They're all out without you havin' fun
(where'd you go..go..go..go..)

Geeze...Ha..

[Part 4 - Rock and roll girlfriend:]
[written and sung by Tre Cool]
I got a rock and roll band
I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
And another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house
I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums
And I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York
I got a kid in the bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin'
In over 22 days
So get off my case
Off of my case
Off of my case!

[Part 5 - We're coming home again:]
Here they come marching down the street
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
The time has come and it going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat
The world is spinning
Around and around
Out of control again
From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
To send my love a letterbomb
And visit me in hell
We're the ones going

Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again

I started fuckin' running
As soon as my feet touched the ground
We're back in the Barrio
But to you and me, that's jingle town

Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again

Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They're all out without you havin' fun


Sing us a song of the century
That’s louder than bombs and eternity
The era of static and contraband
That’s leading us to the promised land
Tell us a story that’s by candlelight
Waging a war and losing the fight
They’re playing the song of the century
Of panic and promise and prosperity
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me

Song of the century

Sing us a song of the century
That's louder than bombs and eternity
The era of static and contraband
That's leading us to the promised land
Tell us a story that's by candlelight
Waging a war and losing the fight

They're playing the song of the century
Of panic and promise and prosperity
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me


I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning

I hold my breath and close my eyes and...
Dream about her
Cause she's 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so...
Never let go
Cause she's 2000 light years away
Years Away!

I sit outside and watch the sunrise
Lookout as far as I can
I can't see her, but in the distance
I hear some laughter,
We laugh together

I hold my breath and close my eyes and...
Dream about her
Cause she's 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so...
Never let go
Cause she's 2000 light years away
Years Away!

I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning

I hold my breath and close my eyes and...
Dream about her
Cause she's 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so...
Never let go
Cause she's 2000 light years away


A thought burst in my head
And I need to tell you
It’s news that I for thought
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago?
I think I just forgot
Well it hasn’t been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad

There’s a boy who fogs his world and now he’s getting lazy
there’s no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up or he’s gonna end up quitting

I shuffle though my mind 
To see if I can find
The words I left behind
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago?
Oh well...
Nevermind.


Go go go 

The year of the rat, the first of the leader 
Somebody shot the babysitter 
They say my middle name is danger 
The kind you keep away from strangers 

I'm singing woahhhh 
I'm out of control 
Oh baby when I see your pretty face 
I say woahhhh 
God rest your fucking soul 
Cause baby baby I was born to go 

I pulled the trigger from the shooting stars 
I am the motor in your crashing car 
I am the cherub and the arab spring 
I am the bullet in your magazine 

I'm singing woahhhh 
I'm out of control 
Oh baby when I see your pretty face 
I said woahhhh 
God rest your fucking soul 
Cause baby baby eyes 
Uh baby baby eyes 
Uh baby baby I was born to... kill






Baby Eyes

Year of the rat, last of the litter
Somebody shot the babysitter
They say my middle name is Danger
The kind to keep away from strangers

I say woah, I'm out of control
Oh baby, when I see your pretty face?
I say woah, God rest your fucking soul
'Cause baby, baby I was born to kill

I pulled the trigger from the shooting stars
I am the motor in your crashing car
I am the cherub in the Arab spring
I am the bullet in your magazine

I say woah, I'm out of control
Oh baby, when I see your pretty face?
I say woah, God rest your fucking soul
'Cause baby, baby eyes

Oh baby, baby eyes
Oh baby, baby I was born to... Kill!
This is definitely not the first video to surface of an execution.
 ...of men, they claimed responsibility for the executions. 
Described as severely mentally disturbed. 
Videos show another hostage executed by the terrorist group. 
Deserve to be annihilated. 

I get my kicks,
And I want to start a rager.
I want to dance,
Like I'm on the video.
I got a fever 
For a violent behavior.
I'm sweating bullets,
Like a modern Romeo.

Bang bang!
Give me fame!
Shoot me up to entertain.
I am a semi automatic 
Lonely boy.
You're dead,
I'm well fed.
Give me death,
Or give me head.
Daddy's little psycho
And mommy's little soldier

I testify, 
Like a lullaby of memories.
Broadcasting live
And it's on my radio.
I got my photo bomb,
I got my Vietnam.
I love a lie,
Just like everybody else.

Bang bang!
Give me fame!
Shoot me up to entertain
I am a semi automatic
Lonely boy.
You're dead,
I'm well fed.
Give me death,
Or give me head.
Broadcasting from my room
And playing with my toys.

I want to be a celebrity martyr.
The leading man 
In my own private drama.
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
The hero of the hour.
Daddy's little psycho
And mommy's little soldier

I want to be like
The soldiers on the screen.
It my private holy war.
Oh baby baby this is 
viva vendetta!
For this is love,
Or it's world war zero.

[x2:]
I want to be a celebrity martyr.
The little man
In my own private drama.
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
The hero of the hour.
Daddy's little psycho, 
And mommy's little soldier.
Where can I find the city of shining light
In an ordinary world
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world

The days into years roll by
It's where that I live until I die
Ordinary world

What would you wish if you saw a shooting star
In an ordinary world?
I've walked to the end of the earth and afar
In an ordinary world

Baby, I don't have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world

Where can I find the city of shining light
In an ordinary world
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world

Baby, I don't have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world
I'm just a mutt
And nowhere is my home
Where dignity's a land mine
In the school of lost hope
I've panhandled for a life because
I'm not afraid to beg
Hand me down your lost and founds
Of second hand regret

You better swallow your pride
Or you're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I'm not the one
I got no pride

Sects of disconnection
And traditions of lost faith
No culture's 
Worth a stream of piss
Or a bullet in my face
To heck with unity
Separation's gonna kill us all
Torn to shreds and disjointed
Before the final fall

You better swallow your pride
Or you're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I'm not the one
I got no pride

You better swallow your pride
Or you're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I'm not the one
I got no pride...

Close your eyes and die...
I got no pride...
I got no pride...
Ha ha you're dead

How do you get your sleep at night? 
  How did you get your noose so tight? 
  Like chewing on tinfoil it's so much fun 
  Gonna be dead before you're gone 

'Cause look how things have gotten 
  And I'll be happy so I won't pretend 
  And I'll be cheering that you're going down 
  And I'll be laughing, I'll be laughing 

How many feelings can you steal? 
  Gotta be part of your appeal 
  I can see through you cause you're wearing thin 
  Like chewing on tinfoil once again 

'Cause look how things have gotten 
  And I'll be happy so I won't pretend 
  And I'll be cheering that you're going down 
  And I'll be laughing, I'll be laughing 

[Chorus:]
  Ha ha you're dead 
  And I'm so happy 
  In loving memory 
  Of your demise 

When your ship is going down 
  I'll go out and paint the town 
  Ha ha you're dead 
  Ha ha you're dead 
  Ha ha you're dead 

[Chorus:]
  Ha ha you're dead 
  The joke is over 
  You were an asshole 
  And now you're gone 
  As your ship is going down 
  I'll stand by and watch you drown 

Ha ha you're dead 
  You're gonna be dead 
  Just remember what I said 
  Ha ha you're dead 
  Ha ha you're dead 
  Ha ha you're dead



Ha Ha You're Dead

How do you get your sleep at night?
  How did you get your noose so tight?
  Like chewing on tinfoil it's so much fun
  Gonna be dead before you're gone

'Cause look how things have gotten
  And I'll be happy so I won't pretend
  And I'll be cheering that you're going down
  And I'll be laughing, I'll be laughing

How many feelings can you steal?
  Gotta be part of your appeal
  I can see through you cause you're wearing thin
  Like chewing on tinfoil once again

'Cause look how things have gotten
  And I'll be happy so I won't pretend
  And I'll be cheering that you're going down
  And I'll be laughing, I'll be laughing

[Chorus:]
  Ha ha you're dead
  And I'm so happy
  In loving memory
  Of your demise

When your ship is going down
  I'll go out and paint the town
  Ha ha you're dead
  Ha ha you're dead
  Ha ha you're dead

[Chorus:]
  Ha ha you're dead
  The joke is over
  You were an asshole
  And now you're gone

Ha ha you're dead
  You're gonna be dead
  Just remember what I said
  Ha ha you're dead
  Ha ha you're dead
  Ha ha you're dead 


Dear mother,
  Can you hear me whining?
  It's been three whole weeks
  Since that I have left your home
  This sudden fear has left me trembling
  Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
  And I'm feeling so alone

Pay attention to the cracked streets
  And the broken homes
  Some call it the slums
  Some call it nice
  I want to take you through a wasteland 
  I like to call my home
  Welcome To Paradise

A gunshot rings out at the station
  Another urchin snaps 
  And left dead on his own
  It makes me wonder why I'm still here
  For some strange reason it's now
  Feeling like my home
  And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets
  And the broken homes
  Some call it the slums
  Some call it nice
  I want to take you through a wasteland 
  I like to call my home
  Welcome To Paradise

Dear mother,
  Can you hear me laughing
  It's been six whole months 
  Since that I have left your home
  It makes me wonder why I'm still here
  For some strange reason it's now
  Feeling like my home
  And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets 
  And the broken homes 
  Some call it slums
  Some call it nice 
  I want take you through a wasteland 
  I like to call my home 
  Welcome to paradise 
  Paradise....


[Intro:]
Now look at you, been walkin in here lookin all pretty and angry, and mean, and good. Now I know you didn't get your hair done so you could just sit down and just sit still.
Aye, we tryna have a good time tonight, let's go over here!
Let's go, baby!

[Verse 1:]
It's my birthday.
No, it's not!
But I still look good, though,
Hot comb hot.
I bet you want an autograph
For you and your friends,
Gotta do it in the penthouse,
That's where I keep my pen.

[Pre-Chorus:]
What, you can't dance? Ain't got rhythm?
What, you got a man? I don't see you with ‘im.
Put your phone down, let's get it,
Forget your Instagram and your Twitter.
Got me like, woah! Wait a minute,
You need to take a minute,
Loosen them shoulders up,
Pour it up, let's work!

[Chorus:]
Throw some perm on your attitude,
Girl, you gotta relax, ooh!
Let me show you what you got to do,
You gotta lay it back.
Matter of fact, band, show her how to lay it back!
Show her how to lay it back!
Show her how to lay it back!
Show her how to lay it back!
Alright!

[Verse 2:]
Come on, baby I love you.
No, you don't!
You never know, I might, though!
Can't say I won't, ah!
There's that smile I'm lookin' for.
Was that so hard?
If you ever need to smile again, girl, take my card.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Razzle-dazzle, never gon' stop,
What you want is what I got.
You wanna get down? You gotta get up,
Don't be stingy with your big ol' butt!
You got a booty like,
Woah! Wait a minute,
I'm just playin' with you.
Loosen them shoulders up,
Pour it up, let's work.

[Chorus:]
Throw some perm on your attitude,
Girl, you gotta relax, ooh!
Let me show you what you got to do,
You gotta lay it back.
Matter of fact, band, show her how to lay it back!

Aye, now you got it, baby. You tryna have some fun tonight, you just gotta follow these simple instructions, you ready?

[Bridge:]
You need activate your sexy,
Silky, smooth and snap.
Now lean with it, throw a lil' sheen in it,
Then pat, pat, pat till it's flat.
One more time.
You need activate your sexy,
Silky, smooth and snap.
Now lean with it, throw a lil' sheen in it,
Then pat, pat, pat till it's flat.

[Chorus:]
I'll sing it again.
Throw some perm on your attitude,
Girl, you gotta relax, ooh!
Let me show you what you got to do,
You gotta lay it back.
Matter of fact, band, show her how to lay it back!
Show her how to lay it back!
Show her how to lay it back!
Show her how to lay it back!
Alright!
I know girl, when you look at me
You don't know how I feel
Cause I'm usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know
Oh, I want you to know

I must admit I've felt this way for more than quite a while
But I can't hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Can't wait no more
Oh, I can't wait no more

Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you

Maybe I'm a fool for speaking up but I don't mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do

And the look that you are givin' me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I'll change my ways I'll
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothin' to lose
I've got nothin' to lose

Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you

Girl when you smile
Not a place I'd rather be
Just stay for a while
Then you'll see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That's why I have to take this time baby to tell ya
Oh, and now you know
And now you know

Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you girl
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
How do I end up in the same old place 
  Faced again with the same mistakes 
  So stubborn, 
  Thinking I know what is right 
  But life proves me wrong every time 

Taking roads that lead me nowhere, 
  How do I expect to get there 
  But when will I learn to just put you first 

I come to you now when I need you 
  But why do I wait to come see you 
  I always try to do this on my own 
  But I was wrong, cause only with you 
  Can I move on (can I move on) 

When I am weak, it's you that makes me strong 
  And I know that you've been with me all along 
  So many times I forget to close my eyes 
  And listen to my heart 
  With you, life is so easy 
  Why do I make it hard 

Oh, taking roads that lead me no where, 
  How do I expect to get there 
  When will I learn to just put you first 

I, I come to you now when I need you 
  But why do I wait to come see you 
  I always try to do this on my own 
  But I was wrong, cause only with you 
  Can I move on 

I'll get out of my own way, 
  Let you have your way 
  Cause I realized I'm no good on my own 
  I'm there for you, I'll serve for you 
  I can't live without you 

I come to you now when I need you 
  Why do I wait to come see you 
  I always try to do this on my own 
  But I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong, 
  With only you, only you, with only you 
  Can I move on, can I move on, can I move on


It's your boy Bruno
Imma take ya to the top girl, hey 
Top of the world, you ready?
C'mon (let's go)

I feel higher than the ceiling
Cause I'm floating on this feelin'
So long my feet have been up off the floor
Destiny is what I call it
My heart's for sale and girl you bought it
The moment that you walk right through the door ooh

Till the day that I stop livin'
Girl my love I won't stop givin'
Cross my heart and hope to die my love is yours
And I pray girl that this feeling
Is something that we always feelin'
If you're with it girl, hear me girl
This is what I'll do

I will give you the world
Put it in your hands
Cause I ain't never felt this way before

On top of the world
Is where we'll stand
You just say the word and girl it's yours

Ha ooooh it feels so good baby yeah 

And to me you're like a flower
It's a blessing every hour
And I get to spend this time with you 
And I won't take you for granted 
Next to you is where I'm standing
Girl you're a dream come true

Till the day that I stop livin'
Girl my love I won't stop givin'
Cross my heart and hope to die my love is yours
And I pray girl that this feeling
Is something that we always feelin'
If you're with it girl, hear me girl
This is what I'll do

I will give you the world
Put it in your hands
Cause I ain't never felt this way before 
(cause I ain't never felt this way before)

On top of the world
Is where we'll stand (where we'll stand girl)
You just say the word and girl it's yours 
(the word and girl it's yours)

Just take my hand ooh
We can float to the sky, baby just you and I
Never let you go
Just take my hand
So many things I wanna show you girl
While we're on top of the world

I will give you the world
Put it in your hands
Cause I ain't never felt this way before 
(cause I ain't never felt this way before)

On top of the world
Is where we'll stand
You just say the word and girl it's yours 
(you just say the word and girl it's yours)

I will give you the world
Put it in your hands
Cause I ain't never felt this way before 
(cause I ain't never felt this way before)

On top of the world
Is where we'll stand
You just say the word and girl it's yours

It's all for you girl
It's all for you
Let's go



I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes
Our eyes
Never

I don't wanna let a minute get away
Cause we got no time to lose
None of us are promised to see tomorrow
And what we do is ours to choose

Forget about the sunrise
Stop the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you
Let's stay this way forever
It only gets better
If we want it to

You Know I, I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes
Our eyes
Never

It's so hard to think this will fade away
What goes up must come down
Why can't we just live life with no consequence
And always live in the now

Forget about the sunrise
Stop the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you
Let's stay this way forever
It only gets better
If we want it to

You Know I, I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes
Our eyes
Never
Oh, I was perfect,
For the circus,
 If she dared me I'd do it,
 Love makes you stupid.
 I gave it up, but I guess it was not enough,
 Cause she never seemed satisfied.

 Oooh ooh

 I know I'm not perfect,
 But at the end of the day,
 Who is?

 Oooh ooh

 She wanted someone that's perfect.
 Well okay,
 But can you tell me 
 Who is?

 Ooooh oooh оoooh
 Ooooh oooh оoooh

 She set the bar,
 Just above the stars,
 A rocket couldn't reach it,
 But I still kept on reaching.
 She watched me try,
 At least a thousand times.

 If she loved me she'd stop me, but no...

 Oooh ooh

 I know I'm not perfect,
 But at the end of the day,
 Who is?

 Oooh ooh

 She wanted someone that's perfect.
 Well okay,
 But can you tell me 
 Who is ?

 I saw something worth my future,
 So wrong, so wrong.
 In my mind I would tell you soon
 But I guess I wasn't wrong

 Oooh ooh 

 I know I'm not perfect,
 But at the end of the day,
 Who is?

 Oooh ooh

 She wanted someone that's perfect,
 Well okay,
 But can you tell me 
 Who is?

 Ooooh oooh Ooooh
 Ooooh oooh Ooooh
[Verse 1:]
Girl, I bet your momma named you Good-lookin',
'Cause you sure look good to me.
My attention, oh, yes, you just took it,
You're probably the finest thing that I ever seen,
And nobody at the party droppin' it low like the way that you do,
You got me sayin', "Damn, girl, break it down for me!"
Take it nice and slow, let me watch while you turn around,
Just back it up on me, girl, right now, right now.

[Chorus:]
I got your body rockin' side to side. Straight up!
I put you on and now you're feelin' right. Straight up!
I know exactly what is on your mind. Straight up!
Oh, baby, we gon' have some fun tonight,
Straight up and down!
Straight up, straight up, straight up!
Straight up and down!
Straight up, straight up, straight up!
Oh, I know exactly what is on your mind,
Oh, baby, we gon' have some fun tonight,
Straight up and down!

[Verse 2:]
This liquor got both of us faded, so gone, so gone, so gone,
But your booty deserve a celebration,
And I'm gonna celebrate it all night long.
Come on here and show me why you got the whole club starin' at you,
You got me sayin', "Damn, girl, break it down for me!"
Take it nice and slow, let me watch while you turn around,
Just back it up on me, girl, right now, right now.

[Chorus:]
I got your body rockin' side to side. Straight up!
I put you on and now you're feelin' right. Straight up!
I know exactly what is on your mind. Straight up!
Oh, baby, we gon' have some fun tonight,
Straight up and down!
Straight up, straight up, straight up!
Straight up and down!
Straight up, straight up, straight up!
Oh, I know exactly what is on your mind,
Oh, baby, we gon' have some fun tonight,
Straight up and down!

[Bridge:]
Girl, tell me when you're ready,
Ready to go.
Just say the word,
And then we'll take this home.
Don't you fight the feeling,
'Cause I feel it too,
Freakin' me, baby, while I'm freakin' you.

[Chorus:]
I got your body rockin' side to side. Straight up!
I put you on and now you're feelin' right. Straight up!
I know exactly what is on your mind. Straight up!
Oh, baby, we gon' have some fun tonight,
Straight up and down!
Straight up, straight up, straight up!
Straight up and down!
Straight up, straight up, straight up!
Oh, I know exactly what is on your mind,
Oh, baby, we gon' have some fun tonight,
Straight up and down!
I've made mistakes
I could have treated you better
I let you get away
There goes my happily ever after

Tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
Oooh, I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

Yeah, I'm still in love with you, darlin'
I know you feel the same
Oh, what's the point of both of us being brokenhearted?
I pray it's never too late

So tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

Oh. Girl, won't you listen? It's you that I'm missin'
Take my hand, I wanna go, I wanna go
If we're gonna fight this fight for better days
I know we're gonna make it. This is the chance, let's take it

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
What can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye



Too Good to Say Goodbye

I've made mistakes
I could have treated you better
I let you get away
There goes my happily ever after

Tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
Oooh, I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

Oh. Girl, won't you listen? It's you that I'm missin'

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
What can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye
I've been working hard so long
Seems like pain has been my only friend
My fragile heart's been done so wrong
I wondered if I'd ever heal again

[Chorus]
Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change (ohh)

I will break these chains that bind me, 
Happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin
I know I can make it, today my life begins

Yesterday has come and gone
And I've learnt how to leave it where it is
And I see that I was wrong
For ever doubting I could win

[Chorus]

Life's to short to have regrets
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
Only have one life to live
So you better make the best of it

I will break these chains that bind me, 
Happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin
I know I can make it, today my life begins [x2]

Today my life begins
Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give
Should've known you was trouble
From the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?

[Bridge:]
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love
Is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand
Is

[Chorus:]
I'd catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on the blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "Hey" 
When you get back to where you're from
Bad womаn, bad womаn
That's just what you are
Yeah, you smile in my face 
Then rip the brakes out my car

[Bridge:]
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love
Is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand
Is

[Chorus:]
I'd catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on the blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
You would watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never ever ever did, baby

But, darling, I'd still catch a grenade for you
Throw my hand on the blade for you
I'd jump in front of a train for you
You know I'd do anything for you

I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same
No, you won't do the same
Oh, you never do the same

No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you'd never do the same
Oh, no no no
There's only so many songs that I can sing
  To pass the time

And I'm running out of things to do
  To get you off my mind
  Oooh...

All I have is this picture in a frame
  That I hold close to see your face everyday
  With you is where I'd rather be
  But we're stuck where we are
  And it's so hard, you're so far
  This long distance is killing me
  I wish that you were here with me
  But we're stuck where we are
  And it's so hard, you're so far
  This long distance is killing me

It's so hard, it's so hard
  Where we are, where we are
  You're so far
  This long distance is killing me
  It's so hard, it's so hard
  Where we are, where we are
  You're so far
  This long distance is killing me

Now the minutes feel like hours
  And the hours feel like days
  While I'm away
  Ya know right now I can't be home
  But I'm coming home soon
  Coming home soon

All I have is this picture in a frame
  That I hold close to see your face again
  Oh!
  With you is where I'd rather be
  (Where I'd rather be)
  But we're stuck where we are(Oh) 
  And it's so hard (Oh)
  You're so far (Oh)
  This long distance is killing me
  I wish that you were here with me
  (You were here with me)
  But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
  It's so hard (Oh)
  You're so far (Oh)

Can you hear me crying?
  (Ooohhh... ooohhhh...)
  Can you hear me crying?
  (Ooohhh... ooohhhh...)
  Can you hear me crying?
  (Ooohhh... ooohhhh...)

With you is where I'd rather be
  (Where I'd rather be)
  But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
  And it's so hard (Oh)
  You're so far (Oh)
  This long distance is killing me
  I wish that you were here with me
  (You were here with me)
  But we're stuck where we are(Oh)
  And it's so hard (Oh), you're so far(Oh)
  This long distance is killing me

It's so hard, it's so hard
  Where we are, where we are
  You're so far
  This long distance is killing me
  It's so hard, it's so hard
  Where we are, where we are
  You're so far
  This long distance is killing me

There's only so many songs that I can sing
  To pass the time... 


Oh, oh I, I was a city boy
Right into dangers where I'd always run, 
A boy who had his fun 
I wouldn't have done
All the things that I've done
If I knew one day you would come

Now, baby, now, baby, now, baby
Oh, oh, oh, I, I know it breaks your heart
To picture the only one you wanna love
In someone else's arms
But I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you would come

Now, baby, now, baby, now, baby
Oh, baby, please
Let's leave the past behind us
So that we can go where love will find us
Yeah, will find us

I know once girls would leave me
But I know that you believe me

Baby, I, I wish we were seventeen
So I could give you all the innocence
That you give to me
No, I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you would come
If I knew one day you would come
Her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining,
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying,
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me,
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see,
But everytime she asks me "Do I look okay?"
I say

[Chorus:]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are,
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me,
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy,
She's so beautiful 
And I tell her everyday

Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change,
If perfects what you're searching for
Then just stay the same,
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
'Cause you know I'll say

[Chorus:]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change,
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are,
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are





Just the Way You Are

Oh her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying

She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah I know, I know
When I compliment her
She won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think she don't see what I see

But every time she asks me do I look okay
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy

She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect is what you're searching for
Then just stay the same

So don't even bother asking
If you look okay
You know I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are


When you want to do something that's new
And it seems really, really hard to do
You feel like quitting, you feel you're through
Well I have some advice for you

Don't give up
Keep on trying
You're gonna make it
I ain't lying
Don't give up, don't ever quit
Try and try and you can do it
Don't give up, yeah

If you want to catch a ball
But you're having no luck at all
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose
It hits your belly, your chin and toes
Well, try and try and try again
Keep on trying until the end
You put your hands out in the air
You'll catch the ball
Yes this I swear

Don't give up,
Keep on going
You're on a boat,
So keep on rowing
Don't give up, don't ever stop
Try and try and you'll come out on top
Don't give up

You got yourself rollerskates
You put them on
And you feel great
You stand up
Then you fall, don't think you can skate at all
You get back up, then you trip,
You skip and tip and slip, and flip
You try and try and try some more
Soon you're skating across the floor

Don't give up, keep on moving,
You're gonna get there, just keep on grooving
Don't give up, don't pack it in
Try and try, and you'll win
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up, no no
Don't give up
She wakes up in the morning 
  Jumps in the shower
  Then rubs on her lotion 
  While she's wrapped in a towel
  Ain't no music but she dance to perfection
  I swear the bathroom's the club 
  The way she's showing off to her reflection

Every morning I watch her from behind

You pick a fight, fight
And I know I do the same
Be callin' you out your name
This is not what lovers are suppose to do

[Verse 1:]
Let's take our time tonight, girl,
Above us all the stars are watching,
There's no place I'd rather be in this world,
Your eyes are where I'm lost in,
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancing all alone.
There's no reason to hide
What we're feeling inside
Right now.

[Pre-Chorus:]
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door,
Ooh, I love that dress,
But you won't need it anymore,
No, you won't need it no more,
Let's just kiss till we're naked, baby.

[Chorus:]
Versace on the floor,
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl!
Versace on the floor,
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl!

[Verse 2:]
Now I unzip the back to watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders,
No, don't be afraid to show it all,
I'll be right here ready to hold you,
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels,
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real.

[Pre-Chorus:]
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door,
Ooh, I love that dress,
But you won't need it anymore,
No, you won't need it no more,
Let's just kiss till we're naked, baby.

[Chorus:]
Versace on the floor,
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl!

Let's just kiss till we're naked.

Hey, baby,
Take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl!
Versace on the floor.
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl!

Don't it feel good, babe
Don't it feel good baby?
'Cause it's so brand new babe, 
It's so brand new baby

Don't it feel good, babe
Don't it feel good baby?
'Cause it's so brand new babe, 
iIt's so brand new baby

Girl, here we are
In this big old empty room
Staring at each other
Who's gonna make the first move?

Been doin' our thing for a minute
And now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way 

Is that all right? Is that ok?
Girl no need to be nervous
Cause I got you all night
Don't you worry about a thing no, no, no

[Chorus:]
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time, go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

Clothes are not required 
For what we've got planned
Oh girl you're my desire
Your wish is my command

Treat you like a princess
Oh girl you're so delicious
Like ice cream on a sunny day
Gonna eat you before you melt away, yeah

Is that all right? Is that ok?
Girl no need to be nervous 
Cause I got you all night
Don't you worry about a thing no, no, no

[Chorus:]
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time, go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

Don't it feel good, babe
Don't it feel good baby?
'Cause it's so brand new babe, 
it's so brand new baby

Don't it feel good, babe
Don't it feel good baby?
'Cause it's so brand new babe, 
It's so brand new baby

[Chorus:]
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time, go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time



Hands over my head
Thinking what else could go wrong
Would have stayed in bed
How can the day be so long?

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, 
Removed all my doubts, so believe

That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you

I missed the first train
Stood out in the rain all day, little did I know
When I caught the next train there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, 
Removed all my doubts, so believe

That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again 

Whoever thought a day gone so wrong 
Would turn out so lovely
I'm so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong 
I wouldn't change a thing

I'd do it, I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through lead me to you
So I'd do it all over again
[2x]

Whoever thought a day gone so wrong 
Would turn out so lovely
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong 
Would turn out so lovely
Oooohhhh ooohhhh

I used to go out of my mind tryna re-define the real meaning of love
I lost my dignity forgot about me I was so lost in us
I had to take on, cause you had me stuck in the middle of nowhere
And my faith it would shake, I know you're trying your best to take me

[Chorus:] 
Dream taker won't you leave me alone
Been standing in the way for far too long
Dream maker now it's taking your place
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay
Dream taker won't you leave me alone
Can't wait til you're gone haven't dreamt in so long

You used to be the man of my dreams only now it seems you were just a nightmare
But this little light of mine told me open my eyes there's more than darkness out there
I'm not gonna run from ya, Imma walk from ya, I'm not afraid of ya, I've escaped from ya
And my faith is in place
In the night I no longer see your face!

[Chorus:]
Dream taker won't you leave me alone
Been standing in my way for far too long
Dream maker now it's taking your place
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay
Dream taker won't you leave me alone
Can't wait til you're gone haven't dreamt in so long

Ooohhhhhhhhhh 
From ashes to ashes and dust to us!
Ooohhhh I'm not gonna run from ya, imma walk from ya, I'm not afraid of ya, I've escaped from ya
I'm not gonna run from ya, imma walk from ya, I'm not afraid of ya, I've escaped from ya (yeahhh)

[Chorus:] 
Dream taker won't you leave me alone
Been standing in my way for far too long
Dream maker now it's taking your place
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay
Dream taker won't you leave me alone
Can't wait til you're gone haven't dreamt in so long
Can't wait til you're gone haven't dreamt in so long
Can't wait til you're gone haven't dreamt in so long

All alone in my room
Waiting for, for this phone to ring
She'll come home someday soon
I just know or am I imagining things
The voices in my head keep saying
(The voices in my head)
She's coming back to you

Is it strange that I talk to myself 
Is it weird when I hear someone else 
What do I do (what do I do)
There's no more you (there's no more you)
And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)
Is it strange I believe them again 
Voices in my head
The voices, the voices, the voices
Voices in my head
The voices, the voices, the voices

Someone's there at the door
This is her I just know (I just know) it is
I get dressed I put on a smile
Oh but  it's just the mail again (the mail again)
The playing in my mind (the playing in my mind)
Saying she'll come back this time

Is it strange that I talk to myself 
Is it weird when I hear someone else 
What do I do (what do I do)
There's no more you (there's no more you)
And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)
Is it strange I believe them again 
Voices in my head

It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok
Oh just gotta get through the day
It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok
Oh I just gotta get through
The voices in my head (the voices in my head)
Keep saying she's coming back to you

Is it strange that I talk to myself 
Is it weird when I hear someone else 
What do I do (what do I do)
There's no more you (there's no more you)
And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)
Is it strange I believe them again 
Voices in my head
Oh, oh, oh
1, 2, 3 oh
He drives a motorcycle, tattoos everywhere
He got a long wrapped sheet, that's right my baby ain't scared
And when he talks that talk, he can back it up, ooh
And when he comes there to it, can nobody come between our love

I know some girls like good boys,
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go

Oh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'mma take you home even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare

He drinks his Jack with no Cola, 'cause he likes to feel the burn
His middle finger to the law, no this boy will never learn
Everything wrong about him, yeah, it turns me on, oh
We live the good life, sleep all day and party all night long

I know some girls like good boys,
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go

Oh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'mma take you home, even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare

Say what you want, but this boy gives me everything
He'll never hurt me or put me off, anything
Mama don't you be scared, your baby girl is grown
And now I've fallen in love

Oh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'mma take you home, even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare
[x2]

You may be my mama's worst nightmare
But you're my dream come true
Hello
You know you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips 
You know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world aint for you, and I know for damn sure this world aint for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free
Ohhh

Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

I know, I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they know that I'm not myself when you gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world, is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright

Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh

Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

Tu-ru-tu dont you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh

Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Ooohhhhhh

So easy to forget our love, the little things we do.
Like callin' for no reason, just to say the words, "Baby, I love you."
I know lately I've been busy, 
But a second doesn't go by without you crossin' my mind.
It's been so long since we had time, 
Let's take a day and make everything alright.
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again.

Let's runaway to the place where love first found us.
Let's runaway for the day, don't need anyone around us.
When everything in love gets so complicated, 
It only takes a day to change it.
What I have to say can't wait,
All I need is a day,
So let's runaway.
Let's runaway, just for the day.
Runaway
Runaway

Girl, you've been so patient, spendin' nights alone and not complainin'
But I'll make it up to you and I promise today I won't keep you waitin'.
Please give me this one chance to remind you of everything we have.
I won't give up, I'm too much in love, and I want you to know that.
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again.

Let's runaway to the place where love first found us.
Let's runaway for the day, don't need anyone around us.
When everything in love gets so complicated, 
It only takes a day to change it.
What I have to say can't wait, 
All I need is a day.

So let's runaway for the day,
And I'll give everything in this moment.
And I promise to make everyday just like today

Let's runaway to the place where love first found us.
Let's runaway for the day, don't need anyone around us.
When everything in love gets so complicated, 
It only takes a day to change it.
What I have to say can't wait, 
All I need is a day,
So let's runaway.
Oh, I never done this before
Never wanna do this again
Wrong turn on a dusty road
I did it to myself, I can't pretend
Well, I learned just a little too late
Good God, I must've been blind
'Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright

Like my daddy I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little Miss Snake eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her doors
'Cause once I get my hands on her, Imma oh

Natalie ‒ she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie ‒ she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch
For this gold-digging bitch
Watch out ‒ she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named
Natalie ‒ if you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run

The good lord better bless your soul
'Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, please, please, please
And now I look at you and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night

I spend a lifetime in jail (yeah, that's what I'll do)
I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah, thinking bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
So there ain't no use in trying
Once I get my hands on you, Imma oh

Natalie ‒ she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie ‒ she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch
For this gold-digging bitch
Watch out ‒ she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named
Natalie ‒ if you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run

I should've known better
(I should've known better)
'Cause when we were together
('Cause when we were together)
She never said forever
(She never said forever)
I'm a fool that played her game, hey

Natalie ‒ she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie ‒ she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch
For this gold-digging bitch
Watch out ‒ she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named
Natalie ‒ if you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run
Once again you're home alone
Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that 
You're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby

Everyday same old things
So you're still feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault

She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

You've been livin this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one your looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see

Everyday same old things
So you're still feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault

She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I can't pretend
Wish we were more than friends

She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

 And I'm not pressing charges
 Don't want you to ricochet and hit another target
 You take me to the edge, right up to the margin
 All I see is fireworks I can feel it sparking
 Hope you keep me at the centre of your bullseye
 And you know it's more benefits of full time
 You are everything and more
 You ain't have to shoot girl 
You had me from the draw

Standing at this liquor store, whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets, cheap beer, that's why you can catch me here
Tryin' to scratch my way to the top

'Cause my job's got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

[Chorus:]
I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

Me and my guitar tonight singing to the city lights
Tryin' to leave with more than what I got
'Cause 68 cent just ain't gonna pay the rent
So I'll be out until they call the cops

'Cause my job's got me goin' nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

[Chorus:]
I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

Here comes Junior Gong, I'm flying high like superman
And thinking that I run the whole block
I don't if it's just 
Because pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top

Feeling like I woulda stand up to the cops
And stand up to the big guys, because de whole lot a dem saps
All de talk dem a talk and dem fly make no drop
Nuff ghetto youth cannot escape the trap

[Chorus:]
Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow




She got it she looking good
I'm just watching her move

She walks on in with her red dress on
Her lips as bright as the sun
Her curves goes every which way
She got skin like porcelain
The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?
Her legs like a supermodel
She worn for them high heel boots

[Chorus:] 
She got every single guy in the club 
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with nobody 
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club 
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with nobody 
Let her do what she do

Just watch her get it (get it...)
Just watch her move

She pulls me to the side
Tells me she wants to go
I say girl I'm yours tonight
After this I'm taking you home
First and for most I dance with you
Get you in the mood
Maybe later baby girl 
I'll show you exactly how I do

[Chorus:] 
She got every single guy in the club 
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with nobody 
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club 
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with nobody 
Let her do what she do

Just watch her get it (get it...)
Just watch her get it (get it...)
Look at her get it (get it...)

Look good baby
You look goood
You are so sexy
Just watch her move
Just watch her move

[Chorus:] 
She got every single guy in the club 
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with nobody 
Let her do what she do

And she don't wanna dance with nobody 
Let her do what she do

Just watch her get it (get it...)
Just watch her get it (get it...)
Look at her get it (get it...)
Just watch her move
Ooh
Staring from my room I see them
Holding hands wish I could be them
Lovers doing what we used to do
(But I'm stuck here alone)
That's the way it's been here lately
You're too busy now to save me
Feels like you forget I'm waiting for you

Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me

How do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I... 
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window

I know you're working that's why you're leaving
I will never argue your reasons
If this means that you believe in them
Oh time goes on and we're growing apart
Broken promises break my heart
Please don't give me a reason to say goodbye
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me

How do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I... 
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window

How can I be what you're saying
When you keep turning all the pages
Am I supposed to believe your words are true
Don't take advantage of me cause you know I won't leave you
I make sure you know I always wanna see you
Whoa won't you do it for me too

Oh how do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I... 
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window
Damn..

It's getting hard to breathe,
I'm trying to make her see,
That she don't really know
That I...
I'm trying to find a way,
And tell her every day, 
That she just goes along
So I...
I don't wanna be,
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Say Good Luck for me,
I'm standing shaking ground,
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it,

[Chorus:] 
Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head, 
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost
I'm already lost...

Damn...

I wish that I could see,
But it's making you
Feel that you should be insane
My love is like gunshot
All it takes is one shot for me to blow it 
All away
I don't wanna feel 
Like I'm just wasting time,
It's gonna be with you and no one else
Until you notice me,
I need to know right now
Cause I've been think it that I'm gonna lose it

[Chorus:] 
Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head, 
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost

May be it's just too hard
But girl you make me nervous,
By now you should have noticed me.
And what will it take it
To a heavenly
Cause your drawing chains 
You're driving me insane!

[Chorus:] 
Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head, 
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost
Ohhh 
Ohhh 

It's not a question of love 
Cause our love has never changed 
But all the little things keep piling up 
And life keeps getting in the way 

Don't make it harder than it is 
We both knew it'd come to this 
Better now than in a year 
More night of tears and we both hate each other 
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss 
Just let it go... 

And stop the madness before it explodes 
Before it's out of our control 
Let's stop the madness before it explodes 
We gotta let it go 
Before it all explodes 

Some things we won't understand 
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood 
So let's just turn around and walk away 
And hold on to what was good 

Don't make it harder than it is 
We both knew it'd come to this 
Better now than in a year 
More nights of tears and we both hate each other 
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss 
Just let it go... 

And stop the madness before it explodes 
Before it's out of our control 
Let's stop the madness before it explodes 
We gotta let it go 
Before it all explodes 

There ain't nothing that can save us 
But you're close to the edge 
And what's the use of going on 
If we're lying to each other 
Every word that is said 
It's too late for us now 
Cause we can never count down 
It's getting close 
It's gonna blow 

Stop the madness before it explodes 
Before is out of our control 
Let's stop the madness before it explodes 
We gotta let it go 
Before it all explodes 

Gotta stop the madness ohhh 

Five, four, three, two, one...
It's a beautiful night,
We're looking for something dumb to do.
Hey baby,
I think I wanna marry you.
Is it the look in your eyes,
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby,
I think I wanna marry you.

Well I know this little chapel 
On the boulevard we can go,
No one will know,
Come on girl.
Who cares if we're trashed 
Got a pocket full of cash we can blow,
Shots of patron,
And it's on girl.

Don't say no, no, no, no-no;
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah;
And we'll go, go, go, go-go.
If you're ready, like I'm ready.

[Chorus:] 
Cause it's a beautiful night,
We're looking for something dumb to do.
Hey baby,
I think I wanna marry you.
Is it the look in your eyes,
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby,
I think I wanna marry you.

I'll go get a ring let the choir bells sing like oooh,
So whatcha wanna do?
Let's just run girl.

If we wake up and you wanna break up that's cool.
No, I won't blame you;
It was fun girl.

Don't say no, no, no, no-no;
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah;
And we'll go, go, go, go-go.
If you're ready, like I'm ready.

[Chorus:] 
Cause it's a beautiful night,
We're looking for something dumb to do.
Hey baby,
I think I wanna marry you.
Is it the look in your eyes,
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby,
I think I wanna marry you.

Just say I do,
Tell me right now baby,
Tell me right now baby, baby. [x2]

[Chorus:] 
Cause it's a beautiful night,
We're looking for something dumb to do.
Hey baby,
I think I wanna marry you.
Is it the look in your eyes,
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby,
I think I wanna marry you.
Ooh I got a bottle full of liquor with a cocaine kicker 
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky 
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

Look what you doing, look what you done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you
I promise is a killer, you'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

You and me baby making love like gorillas
You and me baby making love like gorillas

Yeah I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You're just smiling tell me daddy it's yours
Cause you know how I like it 
Use a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops, 
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT we don't stop, 
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming give it to me baby
Give it to me motherfucker

Ohhh look what you doing, look what you done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you
I promise is a killer, you'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

You and me baby making love like gorillas
You and me baby making love like gorillas

I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
You'll never be the same baby once I'm done with you

Oh you with me baby making love like gorillas
You and me baby we'll be fuckin' it like gorillas
You and me baby making love like gorillas
Ahh yes 

Well looky here looky here 
Ah what do we have? 
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab 
But little does she know 
That I'm a wolf in sheeps clothing 
'Cause at the end of the night 
It is her I'll be holding 

I love you so 
That's what you'll say 
You'll tell me 
Baby baby please don't go away 
But when I play, I never stay 
To every girl that I meet here this is what I say: 

Run run run away, run away baby 
Before I put my spell on you 
You better get get get away get away darling 
'Cause everything you heard is true 
Your poor little heart will end up alone 
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone 
So you better run run run away run away baby 

Well let me think let me think 
Ah what should I do? 
So many eager young bunny's 
That I'd like to pursue 
Now even now they eating out the palm of my hand 
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it 

I love you so 
That's what you'll say 
You'll tell me 
Baby baby please don't go away 
But when I play, I never stay 
To every girl that I meet here this is what I say:

So you better run run run away run away baby!
I don't recognise my reflection
All I see is a product of your deception
Gave you all of me without question
But you had to take advantage of a blessing

I warned you,  I told you
It would end this way
You kept on playing all those childish  games
And just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

[Chorus:]
I'm a killer on the run,
You broke my heart and 
Now you're staring down my gun.
Click clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun,
Was once a good girl  -
Now a killer on the run,
Ki ki ki killa on the run
Killa on the run...

Wipe those tears from your eyes it's too late
With that rag in your mouth can't tell what you say
Slide to the train tracks begging me for mercy
This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me

I warned you,  I told you
It would end this way
You kept on playing all those childish  games
And just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

[Chorus]

You brought this upon yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma's a bitch now shut up and take it
Look at the monster you created
You brought this upon yourself
You brought this upon yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma's a bitch now shut up and take it
Now I'm a monster
A monster you created

[Chorus]



One, two, one, two, three

Oh yeah yeah
  Oh yeah yeah yeah
  Ooh!
  Oh yeah yeah
  Oh yeah yeah yeah
  Ooh!

Never had much faith in love or miracles
  Never wanna put my heart on deny
  But swimming in your world is something spiritual
  I'm born again every time you spend the night

Cause your sex takes me to paradise
  Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
  And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah
  Cause you make feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
  For too long, for too long

I spent all my money on a big ol' fancy car
For these bright eyed honeys.
Oh yeah, you know who you are.
Keep me up till the sun is high,
Till the birds stop calling my name,
I'm addicted and I don't know why,
Guess, I've always been this way.

All these roads would still be wrong,
But I still drive them all night long, all night long.

All you, young wild girls,
You make a mess of me.
Yeah, you, young wild girls,
You'll be the death of me, 
The death of me.
All you, young wild girls,
No matter what you do,
Yeah, you, young wild girls,
I'll always come back to you, 
Come back to you.

I get lost under these lights,
I get lost in the words I say,
Stop believing my own lies,
Like everything will be okay.
Oh, I still dream of simple life,
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife.
But love don't exist when you live like this,
That much I know, yes, I know.

All these roads would still be wrong,
But I still drive them all night long, all night long.

All you, young wild girls,
You make a mess of me.
Yeah, you, young wild girls,
You'll be the death of me, 
The death of me.
All you, young wild girls,
No matter what you do,
Yeah, you, young wild girls,
I'll always come back to you, 
Come back to you.
You, you, you,
You, you, you,
Yeah, you, you, you,
You, you, you.

All you, young wild girls,
You make a mess of me.
Yeah, you, young wild girls,
You'll be the death of me, 
The death of me.
All you, young wild girls,
No matter what you do,
Yeah, you, young wild girls,
I'll always come back to you, 
Come back to you.
You used to tell me that you love me
And that's what you would say
You used to buy me flowers
Even not on valentines day
You would surprise me with a dinner
Even though you just ate
But what happened
Baby what happened

We're been going through some changes
(Through some changes)
Like we in different places
(Different places)
And now you think that you
Can just do what you do
Without any consequences
(Consequences)

It's not what you say
But what you don't say
It's not what you do
But what you don't do
It's not where we go
But where we don't go

It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger
And I don't recognize you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before

You used to look me in my eyes
But now you just look away
If I pull some extra time
You say you just can't stay
Well if you leave me at home alone
For just one more night
I promise it's gonna be the last time

We're been going through some changes
(Through some changes)
Like we in different places
(Different places)
And now you think that you
Can just do what you do
Without any consequences
(Consequences)

It's not what you say
But what you don't say
It's not what you do
But what you don't do
It's not where we go
But where we don't go

It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger
And I don't recognize you no more
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before

What you want me to do
I'm not gonna chase after you 
Tell me how can I get 
Back the man I once met

It's not what you say
But what you don't say
(You don't say)
It's not what you do
But what you don't do
(You don't do)
It's not where we go
But where we don't go
(We don't go)
It's like I don't even know you anymore
(I don't know you no more)
You're just a stranger, a stranger
And I don't recognize you no more
(Don't know you no more)
You're just a stranger (Don't know you no more),
A stranger (Don't know you no more, more no no no)
Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all that it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
And it all just sounds like uh, uh, uh

Hmmm too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made
And it hunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like uh, uh, uh, uh

Too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
Should have gave all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.

Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hands
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!
Everyday I wake up next to a angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
Cause years passed and we're still here today
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

As I stand here before my woman
I cant fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life

Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies by when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait cause I finally found the one
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

As I stand here before my woman
I cant fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life
I'm tripping out
I'm tripping out
We met in a crowded place
Expression on her face
The look in her eyes says she wanted me
So I played it cool
But inside I knew
If I made my move
Then hand it for, she's seconds away

Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I'm not the one, I'm not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind

Tripping out
I'm tripping out
Got me thinking 'bout your love, your love
I'm tripping out
I'm tripping out
Got me thinking 'bout your love
(Got me thinking 'bout your love your love)

Time was standing still
A destiny fulfilled
Just watching her body movement all night long
Then she took my hand, instantly we danced
She knew by my angst that I wanted more

Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I'm not the one, I'm not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind

Tripping out
I'm tripping out
Got me thinking 'bout your love, your love

Got me thinking 'bout your love

Does that make me crazy or infatuated
For imaging me and you?

She was gone before I could say shit
And I aint looking for no replacement
Noo-whoa whoa whoa

Trying to get to her before she's sobers up
Let me see you throw your hands up
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Chorus: x2]

Under the strobe lights
Looking like a star

But everybody started rushing me
Looking through the crowd
Shawty left the scene oh!

Before then we got seperated
She was gone before I could say shit
And I aint looking for no replacement
Noo-whoa whoa whoa
If I gotta almost search the whole club
Trying to get to her before she's sobers up
Let me see you throw your hands up
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

I got too many girls on hold for you to be so bold
Too many on my team for you to act so mean
You say you wanna go and have fun, well you ain't the only one
If I ring, don't let it ring too long or I'm gone

I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the eesha's waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin', playa hatin'?
If this is how it's gonna be
I'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)
Oh, look what you making me do

Honey pie, I'm far too fly to be on standby
Sendin' me straight to voicemail, suga, what the hell?
Oh, you ought to be ashamed, playin' these childish games
I don't get down like that, tell me where you at, hit me back

I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the eesha's waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin', playa hatin'?
If this is how it's gonna be
I'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)
Oh, look what you making me do

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
'Cause all this loving needs a home
Oh no, look at what you started, baby
Now I'm left here broken hearted, baby
There's a pain in my chest I cannot explain
I told myself I wasn't gon' cry (I'm not gonna cry, no no)
Then somebody's gotta come dry these eyes (dry these eyes)

[*phone calling tone*]
"Hi, you've reached Halle Berry. Sorry, I can't get to the phone right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you."
[*mwah*]

I'm calling calling calling calling all my lovelies
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Oh, since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me, baby)
Look what you making me do

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
'Cause all this loving needs a home, oh

[*phone calling tone*]
We had a date, I stood you up
 You tried to call, but I didn't pick up
 See I forgot about our plans, please forgive me 
 For ruining your night so many times

 I'm sorry, I know you're mad
 And I don't wanna be like every other man that you had
 So I'm stoppin' all the childish things,
 Girl, you mean too much to me
 Your love is worth too much to lose

 Girl, I know I broke your heart,
 Trustin' me is really hard
 But watch how quick I change my ways
 Starting today (today)
 Starting today (today)

 I know that I'm the one to blame
 You say every man's the same
 But watch how quick I change my ways
 Starting today (today)
 Starting today (today)
 Girl, I'm starting today

 I'm tired of playin' 
 The kiss and make-up game
 And I apologize for the man I became
 If I could do it all again
 I woulda helped my best friend
 And I would throw away all my selfish ways

 I'm sorry, I know you're mad
 And I don't wanna be like every other man that you had
 So I'm stoppin' all the childish things,
 Girl, you mean too much to me
 Your love is worth too much to lose

 Girl, I know I broke your heart,
 Trustin' me is really hard
 But watch how quick I change my ways
 Starting today (today)
 Starting today (today)

 I know that I'm the one to blame
 You say every man's the same
 But watch how quick I change my ways
 Starting today (today)
 Starting today (today)
 Girl, I'm starting today [x2]
I know you're somewhere out there 
Somewhere far away 
I want you back 
I want you back 
My neighbours think 
I'm crazy 
But they don't understand 
You're all I have 
You're all I have 

Chorus: 
At night when the stars 
Light on my room 
I sit by myself 
Talking to the Moon 
Try to get to You 
In hopes your on 
The other side 
Talking to me too 
Oh am I a fool 
Who sits alone 
Talking to the moon 

I'm feeling like I'm famous 
The talk of the town 
They say 
I've gone mad 
Yeah 
I've gone mad 
But they don't know 
What I know 
Cause when the 
Sun goes down 
Someone's talking back 
Yeah 
They're talking back 

Chorus: 
At night when the stars 
Light on my room 
I sit by myself 
Talking to the Moon 
Try to get to You 
In hopes your on 
The other side 
Talking to me too 
Oh Am I a fool 
Who sits alone 
Talking to the moon 

Do you ever hear me calling?
Cause every night 
I'm talking to the moon
Still trying to get to you

In hopes you're on
The other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool
Who sits alone
Talking to the moon

I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
[Verse 1:]
She got to shake her little something
(Shake her little something)
Throwing that thing from left, right, side to side
She got to have her own money
(She got her own money)
Shout out to the girls that pay they rent on time

[Pre-Chorus:]
If you ain't here to party
Take your ass back home
If you getting naughty, baby, here's my phone
Slide with your boy to the bar
Slide with your boy to the car
I've been searching everywhere and now here you are

[Chorus:]
Chunky
Looking for them girls with the big old hoops
That drop it down in daisy dukes

Yeah, I am the one, so I'm trying to recruit

We'll cha-cha 'til the morning
So just say alright (alright)

[Bridge:]
You got what I want 
(I got what you want)
Girl, you got what I need

Squeeze all of that into my coupe
Girl, I choose you

[Chorus: 2x]
Chunky
Looking for them girls with the big old hoops
That drop it down in daisy dukes
(I wanna get down)
Yeah, I am the one, so I'm trying to recruit
I'm looking at you
Yeah, you baby



It's been so long since you been gone,
And now we're here
The music's on,
We're feeling freaky (oh)
I want you in my bedroom,
You want me closer to you
What are we doing?
Let's get to it

I lay you down,
Take off your clothes,
And kiss your lips
It feels so good, ooh you're saying more
I wanna be inside you
Ooh girl you got that fire
I can't wait no longer 
I just gotta take control

The lights in the club are turning you on
Now girl let's pretend we both are alone
We'll finish this up when we get home
The only thing I need from you girl

Is to press your body,
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just (press it, press it)

My favorite place 
Is that space between your legs 
And yours hips
Ooh, got me licking my lips
Wanna get up on it
It's a special thing that we be doing
F'ina be bad boy
Girl I'm doing (&)
It ain't no secret 'bout what it is
Come on girl serve me the dish

The lights in the club are turning you on
Now girl let's pretend we both are alone
We'll finish this up when we get home
The only thing I need from you girl

Is to press your body,
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just

Press your body,
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just press

Girl you're the only thing that I see
So don't you take your body from me
And there's no other place I'd rather be
Oh girl there's something about your body, body, body
Ooh the way you shakin' is so naughty, naughty, naughty
Right now we got our own little party, party, party
So good,
The way you press your body on me
All I need from you

Is to press your body,
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just

Press your body,

Oh the way you shakin' is so naughty, naughty, naughty
Right now we got our own little party, party, party
So good,
The way you press your body on me
All I need from you
Is to press it...



Truth of the matter is I'm complicated 
You're as straight as they come 
You go 'bout your day baby 
While I hide from the sun 

[Chorus:]
It's better if you don't understand 
Cause you won't know what it's like 
Til you try 

You know I've been waiting on the other side 
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line 
I could wait a whole life time but you just gotta decide 
You know I, I've been waiting on the other, 
Waiting on the other side 

We would live forever 
Who could ask for more 
You could die if you wanted 
But baby what for? 

[Chorus: 2x]
It's better if you don't understand 
And you won't know what it's like 
Til you try 

If they say life's a dream 
Call this insomnia 
Cause this ain't Wonderland 
It damn sure ain't Narnia 
And once you cross the line 
You can't change your mind 
Yeah I'm a monster 
But I'm no Frankenstein 

And quite frankly 
I've been feeling insane in between my eyes 
I really cant explain what I feel inside 
If you knew what I was 
You'd run and hide 

Many have tried to go into the night 
cross over the line and come back alive 
But that's the price we pay 
When we living on the other side 

[Chorus]

It's better if you don't understand [6x]



Feel your heart beating fast
Hold me close make it last
We knew this day would come
So take a breath leave me and
Was so scared of you leaving
Wish we could both just run
Wish we could run it off
But we can't stop time 

Seems the clock is running too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask

You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait 
Wait wait wait for you oh

Our phone calls will have to do
Write you letters just to prove
You're the only thing on my mind
I know it's hard, but we'll get through
Just hold on I promise you
Soon you'll be here by my side
But we can't stop time

Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask

You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh
When I was just a little boy
Barely strong enough to stand
I could always count on him
He taught me everything I know
And 'till this day it shows
He was more than just a friend

There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

[Chorus:]
How would I be where I am
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't
Oh, never say you can't

So when life's rain begins to fall
And you're out there on your own
And you can't see a thing
(Oh, no no no)
Just find a voice that understands
For me it was my old man
Taught me to say the words I can

There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

[Chorus:]
How would I be where I am
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't
Oh, never say you can't

Everything he taught me would stay with me forever
No I won't forget a thing
Oh because of dad I now know myself better
And I hope I can do for him what he did for me

[Chorus:]
How would I be where I am
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't
Oh, never say you can't
Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like?
I hope it feels like tonight, 
Hope it feels like tonight! 
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like, 
I hope it feels like tonight, 
Hope it feels like tonight! 

With that look upon your face, 
Baby I know what you're thinking about, oh! 
You've got your lips along my body, 
And I'm not gonna stop you know, oh! 
You wanna take me to a place, 
Where I can't control my face somehow, oh! 
You know I'm down... 
So boy, you gonna let me down, oh! 
Oh, you got your love dripping all over me, 
The only thing I can say is.. uhuu! 
I don't wanna wait, 
Just... my days, 
It's yours, come get it, get it! 

Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like?
I hope it feels like tonight, 
Hope it feels like tonight! 
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like, 
I hope it feels like tonight, 
Hope it feels like tonight! 

The way you're getting in, 
I can tell you're not playing, no more! 
I'm an angel in disguise, 
With the devil as surprise for you, oh! 
There is no breaking, no stopping, 
Just go, go, go! 
We sing... and don't take it personal! 
It feels like Heaven when... 
Got me screaming on the morning, oh, oh! 
You've got your love tripping all over me, 
The only thing I can say is uhuuu, 
I don't wanna wait, 
Just open up my..., 
It's yours, come get it, get it uhuuu

Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like?
I hope it feels like tonight, 
Hope it feels like tonight! 
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like, 
I hope it feels like tonight, 
Hope it feels like tonight!

So pop it for a pimp
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a pimp
Drop, drop it for me

Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 2:]
I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we go
You can be my freaka
Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest
Is it you? (is it you?) Is it me? (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

[Pre-Chorus:]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all

Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Bridge:]
If you say you want a good time
Well here I am baby, here I am baby

Tell me what's on your mind
If you want it, girl come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby

Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice

Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
I'll be the light to guide you

Find out what we're made of
What we are called to help our friends in need

You can count on me like one, two, three
I'll be there and I know when I need it
I can count on you like four, three, two
And you'll be there 'cause that's what friends
Are supposed to do, oh yeah, ooh, ooh

If you toss and you turn and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Everyday I will remind you

Find out what we're made of
What we are called to help our friends in need

You can count on me like one, two, three
I'll be there and I know when I need it
I can count on you like four, three, two
And you'll be there 'cause that's what friends
Are supposed to do, oh yeah, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah

You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
I'll never let go, never say goodbye

You can count on me like one, two, three
I'll be there and I know when I need it
I can count on you like four, three, two
And you'll be there 'cause that's what friends
Are supposed to do, oh yeah, ooh, ooh

You can count on me 'cause 
I can count on you
Here I am again, doing things I said that I wouldn't do
It's 3 a.m. and I'm rushing out the door to see you
Waiting, all day, but now you wanna call me
Why do you do this to me all the time?

After all the things you put me through, 
Still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely 
If I say I'm gonna leave, 
That's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, 
You only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

Had me fooled from the start 
And I quickly gave my heart
Cause I love you, love you, love you
But this is what happens 
When you're a lonely girl with no one to touch you
Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer
So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything

After all the things you put me through, 
Still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely 
If I say I'm gonna leave, 
That's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, 
You only want me when you're lonely

Oh nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it
You just think of yourself and never me at all
If you're with your friend, you just leave me alone
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on

Cos I can finally see, 
You only want me when you're lonely 
If I say I'm gonna leave, 
That's the only time you want me 
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, 
You only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

I can finally see, 
You only want me when you're lonely 
If I say I'm gonna leave, 
That's the only time you want me 
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, 
You only want me when you're lonely
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there

Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

Little miss perfect sitting at the train stop
Red nike high tops listening to hip-hop
While we were waiting started conversating
Before I got her name along came a train

(uuuuuuuh) next stop Brooklyn
(uuuuuuuh) now I'm lookin'

She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

On the street kickin rocks circling the same block
Green farm Flatbush checking every corner shop
Tappin' people's shoulders askin if they know her
Everyday's the same back to the train

(uuuuuuuh) next stop Brooklyn
(uuuuuuuh) I'm still lookin'

She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wonder if we'll ever meet again
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wonder if we'll ever meet again
Yeah I wonder if we'll meet again
I hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn



Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone, 
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear 
I'm not doing anything

I'm gonna kick my feet up 
And stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobodys gon' tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch 
Just chillin in my Snuggie
Click to MTV so they can 
Teach me how to dougie
Cus in my castle I'm the freakin man

Oh yes I said it, I said it
I said it cause I can

[Chorus:]
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone, 
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear 
I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all, nothing at all

Tomorrow I'll wake up do some P90X
Find a really nice girl 
Have some really nice sex
And she's gonna sream out
'This is great' 
(Oh my god, this is great)

Yeah, I might mess around 
And get my college degree
I bet my old man would be so proud of me
But sorry pops you'll just have to wait

Oh yes I said it, I said it
I said it cause I can

[Chorus:]
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone, 
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear 
I'm not doing anything

No I ain't gonna comb my hair
Cus I ain't going anywhere
No No No No No No No No No

I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

[Chorus:]
Oh, today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone, 
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear 
I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all 
Nothing at all 
Nothing at all





[Verse 1:]
  If you ever leave me, baby,
  Leave some morphine at my door
  'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
  To realize what we used to have,
  We don't have it anymore.
  There's no religion that could save me,
  No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh,
  So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
  Will keep you by my side,
  Will keep you from walking out the door.

[Chorus:]
  'Cause there'll be no sunlight,
  If I lose you, baby.
  There'll be no clear skies
  If I lose you, baby.
  Just like the clouds, 
  My eyes will do the same, if you walk away,
  Everyday, it will rain,
  Rain, rain...

[Verse 2:]
  I'll never be your mother's favorite,
  Your daddy can't even look me in the eyes.
  Oooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing,
  Saying, there goes my little girl,
  Walking with that troublesome guy.
  But they're just afraid of something they can't understand.
  Oooh, well, little darling, 
Watch me change their minds,
  Yea, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try.
  I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding,
  If that'll make you mine.

[Chorus:]
  'Cause there'll be no sunlight,
  If I lose you, baby.
  There'll be no clear skies
  If I lose you, baby.
  Just like the clouds, 
  My eyes will do the same, if you walk away,
  Everyday, it will rain,
  Rain, rain...

[Bridge:]
  Oooh, don't you say, goodbye, 
  Don't just say, goodbye.
  I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding,
  If that'll make it right.

[Chorus:]
  'Cause there'll be no sunlight,
  If I lose you, baby.
  There'll be no clear skies
  If I lose you, baby.
  Just like the clouds, 
  My eyes will do the same, if you walk away,
  Everyday, it will rain,
  Rain, rain...

Give me all, give me all,

A little something about yourself

Honey you're my golden star

Make my wish come true
If you let me 
Treasure you

Pretty girl, pretty girl, 
Pretty girl you should be smiling
A girl like you 
Should never live so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams

But you're fine, so fine

I'm trapped in without her somewhere far away
I keep thinking about her but I know I can't stay
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere
She doesn't leave me alone
I can't escape her or erase her
When I know she's not coming home

I can't understand where I went wrong
I can't understand where her love has gone
I don't know where I belong
My world is over
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(her world goes on)
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(my world is gone)

Am I crazy or just human
Is this what heartbreak is
What should I be doing
It feels like I got seconds to live
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere
She doesn't leave me alone
I can't escape her or erase her
When I know she's not coming home

I can't understand where I went wrong
I can't understand where her love has gone
I don't know where I belong
My world is over
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(her world goes on)
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(my world is gone)

My world is over while her world goes on
(i don't know where I belong
My world is over)
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(her world goes on)
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(my world is gone)
