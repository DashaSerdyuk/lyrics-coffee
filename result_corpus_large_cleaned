In every corner of my memory
 Theres no place you wouldnt be
 lf anything I wish I had
 Another dream with you
 Life was forever yesterday
 Nothing in the world could take
 Your love away
 will I ever know
 That time will ease the pain for me someday

She said I wont leave you ever
 Just love me forever
 She said you can leave but never
 Walk away

Lights reflecting in the evening sun
 Back to the place where we were one
 Soul mates forever about to chase
 Rainbows in the dark
 Another day to destiny
 Come on and set me free
 When I close my eyes I see your smile
 As I walk in the pouring rain
 I call your name

She said I wont leave you ever
 Just love me forever
 She said we will be together someday
 She said I wont leave you ever
 Just love me forever
 She said you can leave
 But never walk away

I can see a million faces
 When I take a walk outside
 But I just never knew
 That I could go a million places
 And Id see always only you

The loneliness crawls up on me
 Without you theres no me
 At any time or any place
 But time will ease the pain for me someday

She said I wont leave you ever
 Just love me forever
 She said we will be together someday
 She said I will wait forever
 I wont leave you ever
 She said you can leave
 But never ever walk away

Dont walk away
 Oh no dont walk away
 Ill be waiting Ill be waiting always
 Until you wake up from this dream
 Someday



She Said  

In every corner of my memory
 Theres no place you wouldnt be
 lf anything I wish I had
 Another dream with you
 Life was forever yesterday
 Nothing in the world could take
 Your love away
 will I ever know
 That time will ease the pain for me someday

She said I wont leave you ever
 Just love me forever
 She said you can leave but never
 Walk away

Lights reflecting in the evening sun

 I call your name

She said I wont leave you ever

 She said we will be together someday
 She said I wont leave you ever
 Just love me forever
 She said you can leave
 But never walk away

I can see a million faces
 When I take a walk outside
 But I just never knew
 That I could go a million places
 And Id see always only you

SOLO 

The loneliness crawls up on me
 Without you theres no me
 At any time or any place
 But time will ease the pain for me someday

She said I wont leave you ever
 Just love me forever
 She said we will be together someday
 She said I will wait forever
 I wont leave you ever
 She said you can leave
 But never ever walk away

Dont walk away
 Oh no dont walk away

Down I am down
On the ground sad and tired
Im down its over now
Yes Im down should I like it

Its deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
Its deep and dark
Since weve been apart

Is this love that comes around
That takes me up light years higher
cause I wanna feel love once again

Its deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
Its deep and dark
Since weve been apart

Its deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
Its deep and dark
Without someones love


Across the desert plains 
 Where nothing dares to grow
 I taught you how to sing
 You taught me everything I know
 And thought the night is young
 And we dont know if well live to see the sun

The best is yet to come
 I know you know
 That weve only just begun
 Through the highs and lows
 And how can I live without you
 Youre such a part of me
 And youve always been the one
 Keeping me forever young
 And the best is yet to come

Dont look now the best is yet to come
 Take my hand the best is yet to come

Thinking of the times
 How we laughed and cried
 I wouldnt change a thing
 I couldnt even if I tried
 Through the wind and rain
 The spirit of our song remains the same

And the best is yet to come
 I know you know
 That weve only just begun
 Through the highs and lows
 And how can I live without you
 Youre such a part of me
 And youve always been the one
 Keeping me forever young
 And the best is yet to come

Dont look now the best is yet to come
 Take my hand the best is yet to come

Oh can you feel it in the air
 Its in your heart and everywhere
 We got to keep that dream alive

We cross another road
 And face another day
 Soldiers never die
 They only fade away
 How can we grow old
 When the soundtrack of our lives is rock and roll

And the best is yet to come
 I know you know
 That weve only just begun
 Through the highs and lows
 And how can I live without you
 Youre such a part of me
 And youve always been the one
 Keeping me forever young
 And the best is yet to come

Dont look now the best is yet to come
 Take my hand the best is yet to come



The Best Is Yet to Come

Across the desert plains
 Where nothing dares to grow
 I taught you how to sing
 You taught me everything I know
 And thought the night is young
 And we dont know if well live to see the sun

The best is yet to come

 That weve only just begun
 Through the highs and lows
 And how can I live without you
 Youre such a part of me
 And youve always been the one
 Keeping me forever young

 Youre such a part of me
 And youve always been the one

 And the best is yet to come

Dont look now the best is yet to come
 Take my hand the best is yet to come

Im a man
 Trying to understand
 The reason Im lost in this world
 Tonight
 I was blind
 I just couldnt see the signs
 Caught in your web of lies

Its too dark to sleep
 Too late to pray
 Too hard to reach
 Too much to save

You were once a friend to me
 Now you are my enemy
 Passion turns to hate and you make
 Hate worth fighting for
 I will rewrite history
 And you will not exist to me
 On the day you crossed the line
 I found out love is war

Life goes by
 Faster than lightning strikes
 Crashes before you can say
 Goodbye

Too scared to run
 Too proud to hide
 Too far to fall
 Too high to climb

You were once a friend to me
 Now you are my enemy
 Passion turns to hate and you make
 Hate worth fighting for
 I will rewrite history
 And you will not exist to me
 On the day you crossed the line
 I found out love is war

I laid down my defenses
 I opened up the door
 I gave you what you wanted
 I couldnt give you more
 And I gave you everything
 You said its all or nothing
 To you its just a game
 A game youre never losing 



Love Is War

Holding on to you like broken glass
Every touch cuts deeper than the last
I know I should leave
But it feels so good to bleed

Poison kisses lock us in this cage
Our lives got twisted in this masquerade
I cant seem to shake this incurable need
This endless addiction I feed

Angels on fire
They fall from the sky
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight
Covered in ashes I cry out your name
And out of the flames
We will rise again

Run in to the shadows where we hide
Bodies tender as our worlds collide
Nothing is sacred and everythings wrong
But you and I keep holding on

Angels on fire
They fall from the sky
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight
Covered in ashes I cry out your name
And out of the flames
We will rise again

No temptation is my sin
Not my darkest deepest whim

Angels on fire
They fall from the sky
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight
Covered in ashes I cry out your name
And out of the flames
We will rise
Angels on fire
They fall from the sky
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight
Covered in ashes I cry out your name
And out of the flames
We will rise again
We will rise again
We will rise




We Will Rise Again

Holding on to you like broken glass 
Every touch cuts deeper than the last 
I know I should leave 
But it feels so good to bleed 

Poison kisses lock us in this cage

We will rise again 
We will rise


Another rainy morning
People rushing by
My head is still in the clouds
I dream with open eyes
Suddenly out of nowhere
She came into my life
Like we know each other
For quite a while

In the sound of silence
Time is standing still
Theres some kind of bond between us
Thats givin me the chill
Do you really wonder
That we can burn the sky
Its written a thousand years ago
In the book of life

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one whos always in my dreams
The one who keeps me goin
When I cant go on
The one that Ive been waiting for
For so long

Suddenly out of nowhere
She came into my life

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one whos always in my dreams

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one whos mine eternally
The one who keeps me dreamin
When Im sad and tired
Who gives my life a meaning
Till the day I die

Are you the one
Are you the one



Are You the One
Another rainy morning
People rushing by
My head is still in the clouds
I dream with open eyes
Suddenly out of nowhere
She came into my life
Like we know each other
For quite a while

In the sound of silence
Time is standing still
Theres some kind of bond between us
Thats givin me the chill
Do you really wonder
That we can burn the sky
Its written a thousand years ago
In the book of life

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one whos always in my dreams
The one who keeps me goin
When I cant go on
The one that Ive been waiting for
For so long

Suddenly out of nowhere
She came into my life

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one whos always in my dreams

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one whos mine eternally
The one who keeps me dreamin
When Im sad and tired
Who gives my life a meaning
Till the day I die

Are you the one
Are you the one


Here I go again
Feels like once upon a time
But this is here and now
You can try to read my mind 
Well life has given me so much 
And so much more
True love is hard to find
When youre on the run

While all those years go by
The clock is ticking way too fast
And I just ask myself
What is going to be last
Ive seen it all but still
Ive seen nothing yet at all
So Im still looking for
Some diamonds and pearls

Byebye girl
Theres a road I gotta find
Called the gypsy life
I miss that life
Like a good old friend

Well friends they come and go 
Some are here and some are gone 
And when the sun goes down
I will walk this road alone 
But now Im here with you
And my heart is full of hope 
That life will bring me back 
Into your open arms

Byebye girl
Theres a road I gotta find
Called the gypsy life
I miss that life
Like a good old friend

Byebye girl
Theres a dream thats still alive
It will take some time 
A long long time 
Until Im back again
Love is the glue that hold us together
Faith and believing is the key this door of forever
And baby you and I were every reason on Earth
To now and again its always us against the world 
Against the world

When the rain fell
And the flood came
And the wind blew hard like a hammer on these walls
We didnt crack or break or fall
We built this house on a rock oh ooh ooh
This house on a rock oh ooh ooh

And there is the time to face stormy weather
But we are always standing strong a lifetime together
Baby you and I we dont regret anything
And now its the two of us again against the wind 
Against the wind

When the rain fell
And the flood came
And the wind blew hot like a hammer on these walls
We didnt crack or break or fall
We built this house on a rock oh ooh ooh
This house on a rock oh ooh ooh

Brick by brick we have set it up
Oh men if these walls could talk
Bit by bit based it on trust
We gave it all we got

When the rain fell
And the flood came
And the wind blew hot like a hammer on these walls
We didnt crack or break or fall
We built this house on a rock oh ooh ooh
This house on a rock oh ooh ooh



Lifes a kind of struggle
 Living in this town
 Im never looking back just no just ahead
 My mind was locked up in a cage
 Always ready to break out
 These heavy chains on me drive me mad

Chorus
 I wanna be in love tonight
 I wanna get you where I got you
 Give it just one night
 I wanna be your love tonight
 Slave me

Powers all that matters
 Only one of us can survive
 Tell me are you strong enough to stay on track
 Will I die and go to heaven
 If life was living hell
 All I know is Im always coming back

Chorus

Get me wreck me
 Chase me check me
 Sex me down my spine
 Take me break me
 Love me hate me
 Make me lose my mind

Chorus
 I wanna be in love tonight
 I wanna get you where I got you
 Give it just one night
 I wanna be your love tonight
 Slave me


I follow the Moskva 
 Down to Gorky Park listening to the wind of change 
 An August summer night 
 Soldiers passing by listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in 
 Did you ever think that we could be so close like brothers
 The futures in the air 
 I can feel it everywhere blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow dream away in the wind of change

Walking down the street 
 Distant memories are buried in the past forever
 I follow the Moskva 
 down to Gorky Park listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams with you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow dream away in the wind of change

The wind of change
 Blows straight into the face of time
 Like a stormwind that will ring the
 Freedom bell for peace of mind
 Let your Balalaika sing
 What my guitar wants to say

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams with you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow dream away in the wind of change

Ooh dark meditation
Your second sight can show my light
In a crystal ball

Sweet are the days intoxication
Crowblack the nights caging my mind
Behind the wall

Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Into the rock to find the cream
Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Pictured life from yesterday

Ooh dark meditation
Deep down inside a stream of light
Begins to flow

Sweet are the days intoxication
Crowblack the nights caging my mind
Behind the wall

Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Into the rock to find the cream
Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Pictured life from yesterday

Pictured life pictured life
Pictured life from yesterday
Is this world out of control
 Say what is right what is wrong
 Do I know this world at all
 I think I do but then I dont
 Im confused by what I see
 I try to understand
 But it makes no sense at all

Im confused by what I feel
 I thought that our love
 Was something that is real
 Does anyone know
 The truth were looking for
 Cant find it anymore
 Does anyone know
 How to make me feel
 For something that is real

So many things that I recall
 When we were young just flying high
 Can we turn our fate at all
 I wish we could say Dont you cry
 Im confused by what I hear
 Girl it seems to me
 Were losing after all

Im confused by what I feel
 I thought that our love
 Was something that is real
 Does anyone know
 The truth were looking for
 Cant find it anymore
 Does anyone know
 How to make me feel
 For something that is real

Another day has just begun
 Life goes on theres no return
 How can I trust anyone
 When honesty is such a dirty word

Does anyone know
 The truth were looking for
 Cant find it anymore
 Does anyone know
 How to make me feel
 For something that is real
 Does anyone know
 The truth were looking for
 Cant find it anymore
 Does anyone know
 How to make me feel
 For something that is real



Does Anyone Know

Is this world out of control
 Say what is right what is wrong 
 Do I know this world at all 
 I think I do but then I dont 
 Im confused by what I see 
 I try to understand 
 But it makes no sense at all 

Im confused by what I feel

Im confused by what I feel 
 I thought that our love 
 Was something that is real 
 Does anyone know 
 The truth were looking for 
 Cant find it anymore 
 Does anyone know 
 How to make me feel 
 For something that is real 

Another day has just begun 
 Life goes on theres no return 
 How can I trust anyone 
 When honesty is such a dirty word 

Does anyone know 
 The truth were looking for 
 Cant find it anymore 
 Does anyone know 
 How to make me feel 
 For something that is real 
 Does anyone know 
 The truth were looking for 
 Cant find it anymore 
 Does anyone know 
 How to make me feel 
 For something that is real 





Those mighty wheels keep rollin on
 On to that crazy place
 That still feels like home
 The world outside is rushing by
 It feels good to take that road
 Time after time

I dont know how you feel
 My heart is beating fast
 It has been way too long
 But here I am Im back

Its good to know youre still around
 Youd never let me down in my city
 You get my feet back on the ground
 Youd never let me down in my city

No regrets well just a few
 You havent lost a thing
 Im still crazy for you

I dont know how you feel
 Are you excited too
 It has been way too long
 Tonight Im back with you

Its good to know youre still around
 Youd never let me down in my city
 You get my feet back on the ground
 Youd never let me down in my city

Ive been no stranger
 To every corner of your heart
 Your dream still lives inside of me

I dont know how you feel
 My heart is beating fast
 It has been way too long
 But here I am Im back

In my city my town
 Deep in my heart Im so proud
 Of my city my town
 Ill never ever let you down

Its good to know youre still around
 Youd never let me down in my city
 You get my feet back on the ground
 Youd never let me down in my city

My city my town


When love kills love 

Suddenly I think I always knew 
 I had my share of mistakes 
 Made quite a few 
 Finally I know and thats for sure 
 I dont look back in anger anymore 

Suddenly the sun comes up again 
 Theres a new beginning 
 When we pass the end 
 Finally I know and thats for sure 
 I dont look back in anger anymore 

When love kills love 
 Will someone rescue me 
 When love kills love 
 Its cutting through so deep 

Suddenly I wake up from the dream 
 Someone tells me 
 Ive been talking in the sleep 
 Finally I know and thats for sure 
 I dont believe in daydreams anymore 

When love kills love 
 Will someone rescue me 
 When love kills love 
 Its cutting through so deep 

Well life goes round 
 And upside down 
 Its pretty mad 

When love kills love 
 Will someone set me free 
 When love kills love 
 Its cutting through so deep 

How can we choose 
 When all we lose Is all we have 

We run away from all the pain 
 We run away from all the pain 

When love kills love 
 Will someone rescue me 
 When love kills love 
 Its cutting through so deep 

When love kills love



You look at a poster
You look at the wall
The wall in the room where you live
Where you live with your stars
Just listen to his records
Now hear what he says
For he says I love you little girl
Come to see me today

Speedys Coming
You live in his heart
Speedys Coming
You live in his heart

You like Alice Cooper
You like Ringo Starr
You like David Bowie
And friends in the Royal Albert Hall
Stick up the pictures movies TV
And Ill bring you the show little girl
Come to see me today x

Speedys Coming
You live in his heart
Speedys Coming
You live in his heart



In the dirty old city
There is my home
There is my home
There is my home
There is my home
Nothing really looks pretty
And Ive been alone
Ive been alone
Ive been alone
Ive been alone

And in my heart many wishes are crying
Living and Dying
And in my heart many wishes are crying
Living and Dying

In the house of darkness
Theres a magic stone
magic stone
magic stone
the magic stone
But I couldnt find it
Cause the shine is gone
shine is gone
shine is gone
the shine is gone

And in my heart many wishes are crying
Living and Dying
And in my heart many wishes are crying
Living and Dying
Living and Dying
Living and Dying


The lights are slowly fading down
Theres no one else just you and me
Nothing ever changed
I see your faces in the crowd
It seems I know each one of you
For all my life
I wish this night could last forever
But its time to go
I saw you laugh I saw you cry
All for one and one for all
Nothing ever changed
The way you sang just blew my mind
It gave me chills from head to toe
What a glorious night
To me it could have lasted forever
But its time to go

A moment in a million years
Is all Ive got for you
A moment in a million years
To make some dreams come true
A moment that I wont forget
Until the day I die
A moment in a million years
Called life

The bus is waiting right outside
To hit the road and once again
I leave you all behind
I chase another dream tonight
And by the time youll be home
Ill be far away
I wish this night could last forever
But its time to go

A moment in a million years
Is all Ive got for you
A moment in a million years
To make some dreams come true
A moment that I wont forget
Until the day I die
A moment in a million years
Called life

A moment that I cant forget
Until the day I die
A moment in a million years
Called life



A Moment in a Million Years

Its early morning
The sun comes out
Last night was shaking
And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin
So what is wrong
With another sin
The bitch is hungry
She needs to tell
So give her inches
And feed her well
More days to come
New places to go
Ive got to leave
Its time for a show

Here I am rock you like a hurricane
Here I am rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning
It starts to shout
Desire is coming
It breaks out loud
Lust is in cages
Till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it
With someone I choose
The night is calling
I have to go
The wolf is hungry
He runs the show
Hes licking his lips
Hes ready to win
On the hunt tonight
For love at first sting

Here I am rock you like a hurricane
Here I am rock you like a hurricane
Here I am rock you like a hurricane
Here I am rock you like a hurricane
Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make men more wise

Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just heard my brain
But will it seem the same

Come tomorrow will I be older
Come tomorrow may be a soldier
Come tomorrow may I be bolder than today

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been

Fall into your passing hands
Please dont destroy these lands
Dont make them desert sands

Come tomorrow will I be older
Come tomorrow may be a soldier
Come tomorrow may I be bolder than today

Come tomorrow will I be older
Come tomorrow may be a soldier
Come tomorrow may I be bolder than today

Come tomorrow will I be older
Come tomorrow may be a soldier
Come tomorrow may I be bolder than today

Shapes of things

Can you feel it love is waiting there
When you feel it Ill be waiting there

Something has come over me
I cant explain how full and free
I want you to feel it
Suddenly deep inside I have peace on my mind
I want you to feel it

On the last day that I walked the earth
I found the answer to the question that we all search
Where do we go from here

Can you feel it love is waiting there
When you feel it Ill be waiting there

Come inside now you are cold
No colours block unopen doors
I want you to feel it
Suddenly deep inside you have peace on your mind
Tell me can you feel it

Its the last chance to take a look inside
Its up to you to change the world for a better life
Where do we go from here

Can you feel it love is waiting there
When you feel it Ill be waiting there
Can you feel it love is waiting there
When you feel it Ill be waiting there



The easy way
 Is not the way my life will take
 Because the limit is the sky
 The easy way
 Is not the way that I can take
 My lifes in pieces half the time

Dancing on a razor blade
 Break the ice but never break
 Where the time meets destiny
 Take your chance and come with me

Aleyah

The easy way
 Is not the way that I can take
 I keep on dancing in the sky
 Its the way
 And not the goal that will make it
 All so special in my life

Dancing on the pulse of time
 Bring it home across the line

Come with me
 Aleyah

Dancing on a razor blade
 Break the ice but never break
 Where the time meets destiny
 Take your chance and come with me

Aleyah

Life in the fast lane
 Dont you think baby
 To make it up there
 We gotta be crazy


When the daylight is falling down into the night
And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill
But its more like spinning wheels of fortune
Which never stand still

Big city big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city big city nights

When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes
And the long night has left me back at somebodys side
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before
But its more like looking out for something
I cant find anymore

Big city big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city big city nights
Always yearning
Big city big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city big city nights

There is no dream
That you cant make true if youre looking for love
But theres no girl
Whos burning the ice away from my heart
Maybe tonight

Big city big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city big city nights
Always yearning
Big city big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city big city nights


Im lost in your eyes
Reaching out to cross the great divide
You are drifting away
Mind and soul and body day by day

Nathings stopping you and I
Its do or die tonight

So tell me why Im alone
When were lying here together
On a night thats so cold
And youre just a touch away
Baby try to hold on
Till we make it to forever
Were alive
And the future never dies

Ive been dying inside
Holding back the tears I never cried
Now Im down on my knees
Cause everything you are is what I need

Youre the meaning of it all
Dont let me fall youve gotta

Tell me why Im alone
When were lying here together
On a night thats so cold
And youre just a touch away
Baby try to hold on
Till we make it to forever
Were alive
And the future never dies
Were alive
And the future never dies

Weve got to come together
Cause everybody needs a heart to hold
Cant you see its now or never
Cause weve got nowhere else to go

Tell me why Im alone
When were lying here together

Baby try to hold on
Till we make it to forever
Were alive
And the future never dies
Were alive
And the future never dies
In your eyes
The future never dies


Ah you turn me on
Ive been the biggest fan of yours
Ah ah theres something more
So much more baby

Ah I cant be cool
Its getting stronger every day
Well yeah pictures of you
I cut them out baby

Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain

I cant get enough
Too hard a body drives me mad
Oh yeah its like a drug
Suspender love baby

Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
Theres a place I know so well
Behind closed eyes theres a pearl inside a shell
From time to time I come to see
If this world still has a place for me

When I put my head to sleep
Take the rest my body needs
Thats the time my mind is up and away

We are dreamers all of our lives
We are dreamers your dream will be mine
Forever dream on dreamer

It doesnt matter where youre from
The door is open all the time for everyone
Theres a place I know so well
Will I find you only time will tell

Well its been a long long time
Since Ive seen that state of mind
Right now my friend Im up and away

We are dreamers all of our lives
We are dreamers your dream will be mine
Forever dream on dreamer

We are dreamers always light years apart
Forever dream on dreamer

When I put my head to sleep

We are dreamers all of our lives
We are dreamers your dream will be mine
Forever dream on dreamer

We are dreamers thats what we are
We are dreamers always light years apart
Forever dream on dreamer

Theres a place I know so well
Dream on dreamer
In a run down bed and breakfast
A room with a view across the river
I tried to loose the claustrophobia
Opened up and find Utopia
Theres no more denying
As my mind go flying
 light years away to save my soul
 light years away to change it all
Whatever it may take I gotta try again
Girl its time to start over
 light years away
Id been watching the reflection
Of a bamboo in the shade when I saw her
A very hot day in Havana
In a midnight blue lagoon
I knew she was hiding
 light years away so take me home
 light years away to change it all
Help me find today
Its been way too long
Girl its time to start over
 light years away
Theres no more denying
As my mind go flying
 light years away to save my soul
 light years away to change it all
Whatever it may take I gotta try again
Girl its time to start over
 light years away so take me home
 light years away to change it all
Help me find today Its been way too long
Girl its time to start over
 light years away

Cant get enough of the girl that I love 
Shes hot like the fire which burns on the sun 
She turns me on and my minds goin round 
Hot lovin woman is back in town
Well just to make me feel alright 
All night long oh yeah 
But just to make me feel alright 
All night long
Yeah Id like to tell you something now
Before madness shows her lucid feathers in the Sky

How can you lose your mind
How can you waste your time only like that
Look at the sun inside of my hand so bright
I call it music 
And if you touch youll see
It comes from infinity
Its made forever
You will not touch in vain
Music will make you sane
Will make you sane
Dark night There is no light
In the realm of the black magic man
Souls flight into the cold blight 
Of the destroyers magic land
Poor man Those spirits are stronger
There the ones who will reign
Your strugglings are in vain
Blind man Youre sucking your own blood
Soon black magics dying
Youd better start crying
Burn out Your evil desire
The dark Angels Kingdom
Is built out of mine
Keep on For the Kingdom of light
There is no darkness 
And there is no night



Woman you can change my world
Woman you can change my world 

Im chained to the fears
Inside these walls
The silence talks loud
bout the things I recall
Through the bricks in the window
I scream at the world
But when no one is listening
Its hard to be heart

Woman you can change my world
Woman therell be no return

I see shadows
Coming through the walls
I hear voices
But no ones talking at all
I can feel the madness
Crawling up my spine
Reachin out
To grab your mind

Woman come and change my world

Do you remember all those fears
They wont leave me alone
Do you remember all those tears
I pretend to be strong
Do you remember all the pain
Im getting tired of the game
I cannot live I cannot die
I wanna know who the hell am I

Youve never seen me
But I know you so well
And before it kills me
I gotta break the spell
The deeper we touch
The higher well go
The time has come
To heal my soul

Woman you can change my world 

Do you remember all those fears
They wont leave me alone
Do you remember all those tears
I pretend to be strong
Do you remember all the pain
Im getting tird of the game
I cannot live I cannot die
I wanna know who the hell am I

Woman Im gonna change your world


I see a rainbow in the sky
 So many colors and the light
 I see the world and I see all the people
 How theyre running all the time

I see your shadow over me
 Then in my ears I hear a symphony
 I see the world and I see all the people
 What they are doing what they need

They need a million and a billion
 And your money too
 They need a million and a billion
 And your moeny too

I feel fine though I realize
 That I dont need the million
 They are all poor

I feel fine though I have eyes
 To see my world and all it skits on ice 


She looked like mother nature
Dressed up in black
She had a ying and a yang
Tattooed on her back
A pretty little blonde on a big white horse
I wanted a ride she said of course

Lets rock lets roll
The partys on were having a ball
Were gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put the rock back in the roll
Lets rock lets roll

She looked like a dancer
And god only knows
She must have had a thing
For Scorpions
To make little love wouldnt be no crime
And what came next really blew my mind

Lets rock lets roll
The partys on were having a ball
Were gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put rock back in the roll
Lets rock lets roll

Coming together
Rocking forever lets rock
The partys on
All night long lets rock

Lets rock lets roll
The partys on were having a ball
Were gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put rock back in the roll
Lets rock lets roll

The partys on were loosing control
Were gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put rock back in the roll


Were gonna leave a sting in your soul sting in your soul
Good morning lethargy
Drink Pepsi its good for energy
The baths on smoke in the bedroom
Sore throat and on my neck a nasty bruise
And where it came from well I dont know
But we played last night it was a good show
Got to play a second rate chat show
Its a nationwide deal so we gotta go
Chuck from the Company says itll be alright
Got an ad on KROQ
And theres an instore tonight
Well I build things up never let them go
Got to get time share on the radio

Look inside America
Shes alright shes alright
Sitting out in the distance
But Im not trying to make her mine
Looking for America
With its kooky nights and its suicides
TV says its alright
Cause everybodys hung up on something or other

Stepping off in twenty so the driver says
I should sleep tonight but I think Ill watch videos instead
Annie Hall leaves New York in the end
Press rewind and Woody gets her back again
And the whole world could have passed through me
But I dont know that it means much to me

Look inside America
Shes alright shes alright
Sitting out in the distance
But Im not trying to make her mine
Im looking for America
With its kooky nights and its suicides
TV says its alright
Cause everybodys strung out on something or other

And the whole world could have passed through me
But I dont know that it means much to me


Yeah lets fly away from here
And scream if you like it
The world out there disappears
Tell me are you excited

So lets rattle and roll and shake
The sweat hits the ceiling
Tonight we will slip away
Just rocking and reeling

Beyond the point of no return
The fevers rising till well crash and burn
Theres something in my veins that is thicker than blood
Nothing in the world this is all weve got

So come on if you wanna feel the sting
Come on come on baby shake that thing
I wanna turn you on

Yeah lets celebrate all night
Were starting all over
You turn me into a wild
And hard Rockn Roller

Into the light out of the dark
A passion never known invades my heart
The universe is rocking like heaven and hell
If Im coming back hard to tell

So come on if you wanna feel the sting
Come on come on baby shake that thing
Mama rock on and feel the sting
Come on come on and let the show begin
I wanna turn you on
Away for a long time but never gone
 So many good times I recall
 Forgive me that Ive been kind of blind
 Ive been running away most of my life
 Girl I wanna be with you
 Its no one else its only you
 Oh girl I wanna stay with you
 With no one else just with you
 I was lost for a long time couldnt find myself
 The cry for love was the cry for help
 Forgive me that Ive been so untrue
 The one who saved mes been always you
 Girl I wanna be with you
 Its no one else its only you
 Oh girl I wanna stay with you
 With no one else just with you
 With no one else just with you
 Lifes been dancin on a razorblade
 I had my share of love and hate
 Well after all I found myself
 Cause its you who makes me live
 Its only you who can forgive

Away for a long time but never gone
 Sometimes life just takes the long way home
 Youre still the one Im dreamin of
 Cause when your heart is talkin you know its love
 Oh girl I wanna be with you
 Its no one else its only you
 Oh girl I wanna stay with you
 With no one else just with you
 Oh girl I wanna be with you
 Its no one else its only you
 Oh girl I wanna stay with you
 With no one else just with you
 With no one else just with you


Every moring when I wake up yawning
Im still far away
Trucks still rolling through the early morning
To the place we play
Boy your home youre dreaming dont you know
The tours still far away
Boy your home youre dreaming dont you know
Youre having just a break
Dream were going out on stage it feels like
Coming home again
Dream were going out on stage it feels like
Coming home again
Dream were going out on stage it feels like 

Year after year out on the road
Its great to be here to see you all
I know for me it is like
Coming home

Day after day out on the road
Theres no place too far that we wouldnt go
We go wherever you like
To rockn roll

Jump on the seats put your hands in the air
Give me a shout let me hear youre out there
The wilder you scream for some more rockn roll
The higher well go

Year after year out on the road
Its great to be here to rock you all
I know for me it is like
Coming home
Like coming home 
Leaving through the back door
Freezing in the cold
Communication breakdown
Emotional overload
Been through a wall of fire
Now I feel like a ashes glow

Cars passing on the freeway
My mind is on the run
I keep running from my shadow
Im not the only one
Somewhere in the distance
Someones taking flight
Destination unknown
Just fade into the light

Theres so much said and done
But after all
The time has come to leave it all
Behind

If you could see it through my eyes
Youd know I tried to change it all
Ive been trying all my life
To stand up every time I fall
If you could see it through my eyes

I feel sadness up my spine
The future on my hands
Im standing here alone
With open arms again
Tomorrow aint no stranger
Therell be a lucky star
And love will find its way
Into someones heart

Too late for tears
No time to be confused
Its just the echo of our
Swan song

If you could see it through my eyes
Youd know I tried to change it all
Ive been trying all my life
To stand up every time I fall
If you could see it through my eyes
Youd see that love will always wait
Somewhere out there is my life
A new love that comes my way
If you could see it through my eyes
Through my eyes

What was meant to be forever
Is breaking all apart
What was meant to be forever
Leaves the hole insinde my heart
What was meant to be forever
We throw it all away
Was nothing but a game
Is breaking all apart
What was meant to be forever
A girl to drive a car to love
The music rocks me down the motorway
My whores got wings were taking off
And I cant stop this flight of speed today

Its a lovedrive on wheels of fire
A lovedrive just one desire love
You drive me crazy babe x

The city lights of London town
Are far away my hand is on her wing on her wing
I stop the car and she gets down
Id like to show why Scorpions got a sting

Its a lovedrive on wheels of fire
A lovedrive just one desire love
Sweet love you drive me crazy babe x

You drive me crazy babe x
Good times bad times
Bad times good times

We were twisting Chubby Checker style
In a roaring sixties summer night
We walked the moon and we were free
When Jimi played guitar
We shared a dream with Martin Luther King

We saw JFK in West Berlin
When he spoke those famous words that day
Our world was not the same

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life your life
Let the film just roll

We were lost in shock the world was doomed
Nikita hit us with a shoe
We watched the world go upside down
When the Kennedys got shot
We were screaming when the world was fab
We had Rock n Roll invade our hearts
We had Elvis Janis Marilyn
And hair to let it grow

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life your life
Let the film just roll

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life your life
Were still standing after all

Back in the cold war
Our hearts were warm
Just because sex was free
In the summer of love

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life your life
Let the film just roll

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life your life
Were still standing after all

Good times bad times
Bad times good times

Im still standing
Let the film just roll
Im still standing
Were still standing after all
You get me loose
I want ya thats all I do
You leave me loose
I want ya thats all I do
Make love to me right now
Love me till Im down
You make me groove
I want ya thats all I do
You let me groove
I want ya thats all I do
Make love to me right now
Love me till Im down
Who are you
Your magic is strange and new
Who are you
I want ya thats all I do
Make love to me right now
Love me till Im down
Make love to me right now
Love me till Im down

I gotta fight for you yes I do

The only king of rock has gone gone to heaven
A star on the way to the stars
Another king of rock is born 
Just born to be there when it starts

Chorus
 if the world is still alive
Will be the start for the riot of your time
Heres a ticket for a burning train
To set the world in flame
To play the hero game
Heres a ticket for the future days
Youll be the xrock king
The new electric face
A new generations mind
The riot of your time

Hes got the message to be more
A new desire
A storm full of life wild and young
The xrock electric fire
Will burn out the time like the sun

Chorus
Im a little tin soldier 
That wants to jump into your fire 
You are a look in your eye 
A dream passing by in the sky 

I dont understand 
All I need is treat me like a man 
Cause I aint no child take me like I am 

I got to know that I belong to you 
Do anything that you want to do 
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you 

All I need is your whispered hello 
Smiles melting the snow nothing heard 
Your eyes are deeper than time 
Say a love that wont rhyme without words 

So now Ive lost my way 
I need help to show me things to say 
Give me your love before mine fades away 

I got to know that I belong to you 
Do anything that you want to do 
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you 
Oh no no no 

I dont need no aggravation 
I just got to make you my occupation 

I got to know that I belong to you 
Do anything that you want to do 
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you 

I got to know that I belong to you 
Do anything that you want to do 
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you 

I dont need no aggravation 
I just got to make you my occupation 

I dont need no aggravation

     The Small Faces
And I see the tears in your eyes
The rain will fall tonight
And tonight well go to the sky
Because and we fly

All together
Fly to the sky
Fly to the rainbow
Fly people fly
Fly people fly

And I see the smile on your face
When you look into space
Hes so bright and he is so great
Come on or its too late

All together
Fly to the sky
Fly to the rainbow
Fly people fly
Fly people fly

See the rainbow in the sun
The man will not go
And the world they have no fun
Hurry up people run

All together
Fly to the sky
Fly to the rainbow
Fly people fly
Fly people fly x
Open my mind 
 Let me find new vibrations
 Tell me the way I must take to reach my destination
 And a place where I can stay
 Where is the love of my life couldnt find her
 Show me the way to find back to myself
 Cause Im nowhere in the darkness of these days

Is there anybody there who feels that vibration
 Who shows me the way to my love
 Is there anybody there with that inclination
 To bring back to sun to my heart

I find myself in a state of confusion
 Lifes like a pantomime trick or a laser illusion
 Wheres a place that I can stay
 Save me dont let me get lost in the ocean
 I need your help everyday to control my emotions
 In the darkness of these days

Is there anybody there who feels that vibration
 Who shows me the way to my love
 Is there anybody there with that inclination
 To bring back the sun to my heart



Is There Anybody There

Here I am
Writing my last song for you
Hear the words carefully
And youll see its you
Im leaving
Dont want to be the one to tell you
That I cant stay another day

Ill throw the pages on the floor
Im starting over like before
Ill change this stupid ending
And stay with you forever more
But when Im lying next to you
Its hard to bargain with the truth
Cause when you know the love is gone
The time has come to write your last song

There you are
Smiling at me from the next room
Beautiful as the first day I met you
And Im so sorry
I couldnt be the one to love you
The way that you deserve to be

Ill throw the pages on the floor
Im starting over like before
Ill change this stupid ending
And stay with you forever more
But when Im lying next to you
Its hard to bargain with the truth
Cause when you know the love is gone
The time has come to write your last song

Its hard to think of you and I
As total strangers
Ive lived this last goodbye
A million times or more in my mind
My mind my mind

Oh and Im gonna miss you
But I cant go back
Even just to kiss you
Cause I cant exist
Just living a lie
Gotta lot of love to give
You know before I die
And as I watch you
Sing along
Its killing me to know
That its your last song


A live begins anothers over 
As another day begins 
Life runs full circle getting older 
It happens to me 
It happens to you 
I do believe youre still around me 
Youre still around me all the time 
I have no doubt one day in heaven 
I will see you again 
Ill see you again see you again 

Break the bread drink the wine 
In my heart youll live forever 
The time to go is never right 
When we say goodbye 
While were here we shouldnt waste 
A day in life to say I love you 
Its now that Id just wish so much to see you 
Eye to eye 

When you came home the war was over 
So many years before my time 
I was so proud the day you told me 
You havent hurt anyone 
No one 

Break the bread drink the wine 
In my heart youll live forever 
The time to go is never right 
When we say goodbye 
While were here we shouldnt waste 
A day in life to say I love you 
Its now that Id just wish so much to see you 
Eye to eye

Lets spend the night together
 I know you want it too
 The magic of the moment
 Is what Ive got for you
 The heartbeat of this night
 Is made to lose control
 And there is something in your eyes
 Thats longing for some more
 Let us find together
 The beat were looking for

Chorus
 The rhythm of love
 Keeps me dancing on the road
 The rhythm of love
 Got the groove that hits the bone
 The rhythm of love
 Is the game Im looking for
 The rhythm of love
 Is the heartbeat of my soul

Lets reach the top together
 One night will never do
 An exploding shot of pleasure
 Is what Ive got for you
 Why dont you close your eyes
 And let your feeling grow
 I make you feel the taste of life
 Until your love will flow
 Let us find together
 The beat were longing for

Chorus

Let us find together

Its early morning
 The sun comes out
 Last night was shaking
 And pretty loud
 My cat is purring
 And scratches my skin
 So what is wrong
 With another sin
 The bitch is hungry
 She needs to tell
 So give her inches
 And feed her well
 More days to come
 New places to go
 Ive got to leave
 Its time for a show

Here I am rock you like a hurricane
 Here I am rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning
 It starts to shout
 Desire is coming
 It breaks out loud
 Lust is in cages
 Till storm breaks loose
 Just have to make it
 With someone I choose
 The night is calling
 I have to go
 The wolf is hungry
 He runs to show
 Hes licking his lips
 Hes ready to win
 On the hunt tonight
 For love at first sting

Here I am rock you like a hurricane
 Here I am rock you like a hurricane
 Here I am rock you like a hurricane
 Here I am rock you like a hurricane


I wake up in the morning
And the sun begins to shine
The day did sneak up on the night
I see your face and I see myself
And I get a little taste of life
I try to stand it for a while

But Im In Trance
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling
Im In Trance
I take too much in the Saturday Night Hey Yeah
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling
Im In Trance
I want to try to stop this life

I feel so sad Im feeling down
On the radio the music plays
Im in love with her and I feel fine
I close my eyes I think today
Its getting better with a sip of wine
And I can stand it for a while

While Im In Trance
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling
Im In Trance
I take too much in the Saturday Night Hey Hey
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling
Im In Trance
I want to try to stop this life

Im In Trance
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling
Im In Trance
I take too much in the Saturday Night Hey Yeah
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling
Im In Trance
I want to try to stop this life
Aaaaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaaaah


Ive been around the world
Ive known a lot of girls
Livin and lovin
Its hard to keep them all in line
Ive seen a lot of sights
Many crazy nights
Cruisin and boozin
Its a wonder that Im still alive

Never wasted any time
Never missed a beat
Total satisfaction
Always guaranteed

Tease me
Please me
No one needs to know
Tease me
Please me
Before I have to go

Spead the world around
The boys are back in town
Reelin and rockin
Were rollin with it win or lose
The girls are dressed to kill
Lookin for a thrill
Slidin and glidin
Sometimes they make it hard to choose

I never wasted any time
Never missed a beat
Total satisfaction
Always guaranteed

Tease me
Please me
No one needs to know
Tease me
Please me
Before I have to go
Tease me
Please me
Well take it nice and slow
Tease me
Please me
Just let the feeling grow
Hey you Im in love with your eyes
And the sound of your name
Hey you Im in love with your smile
And the way youre dressed today

Hey you well I like the way you walk
Just like a star moves on stage
Hey you well I like the way you talk
Youre really calm for your age

I really die
Youre driving me wild
I really die
Im in love a hundred times

I really die
Youre driving me wild
I really die
Im in love a hundred times
To be your answer

Hey you I said you know whats going on
Do you know what I mean
Hey you daddy wants you to come
This school is up to me

I really die
Youre driving me wild
I really die
Im in love a hundred times

I really die
Youre driving me wild
I really die
Im in love a hundred times
To be your answer

It seems to me a nightmare becomes reality
The last days of the paradise are gone for you and me
Were living in the crossfire
And well be killed at first
Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world

Understand
that we dont wanna fight
Understand
that we are muh too young to die
Understand
no one will survive
Understand
that we love our life

Can I trust the meaning of the life line in my hand
Which is as long as exciting hundred years
I could be a lucky man
But Im living in the crossfire
Of a time that starts to burn
Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world

Understand 
that we dont wanna fight
Understand 
that we are muh too young to die
Understand 
no one will survive
Understand 
that we love our life
Force yourself to use your brain
The only way to gain
A lot of things are just a lie
This world we love comes down in pain
With hate and bloody games
A questionmark up in the sky oh no

Look you cant keep away
And you cant hide
Tomorrow yesterday today

Some people sayWell do it better
Some people sayEverythings good
Some people singLets come together
But nobody has ever brought it through

Maybe you and me maybe you and me
You and me you and me you and me
Save me from myself before Im going down
My world went kind of crazy spinning roundnround
My bodys in a mess from head to toe
Got nothing to lose and nowhere to go

Im driving out of town just follow my heart
I think Im gonna be a rocknroll star
The girls would go mad Id give em all I can give
If I had a cheap guitar and one dirty riff

Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail

Rocking night after night day after day
Theres plenty of love and no escape
Lifes screaming and rolling like a monster train
Destination to nowhere I wont be late

Jo Jo I got to go
Here comes another show

Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
The job is done and I go out
 Another boring day
 I leave it all behind me now
 So many worlds away

I meet my girl shes dressed to kill
 And all we gonna do
 Is walk around to catch the thrill
 On streets we call the zoo

Chorus
We eat the night we drink the time
 Make our dreams come true
 And hungry eyes are passing by
 On streets we call the zoo

We eat the night we drink the time
 Make our dreams come true
 And hungry eyes are passing by
 On streets we call the zoo

Enjoy the zoo
 And walk down nd Street
 You wanna be excited too
 And you will feel the heat

Chorus x
We eat the night we drink the time
 Make our dreams come true
 And hungry eyes are passing by
 On streets we call the zoo


The Zoo
The job is done and I go out
 Another boring day
 I leave it all behind me now
 So many worlds away

I meet my girl shes dressed to kill
 And all we gonna do
 Is walk around to catch the thrill
 On streets we call the zoo

Chorus
We eat the night we drink the time
 Make our dreams come true
 And hungry eyes are passing by
 On streets we call the zoo

We eat the night we drink the time
 Make our dreams come true
 And hungry eyes are passing by
 On streets we call the zoo

Enjoy the zoo
 And walk down nd Street
 You wanna be excited too
 And you will feel the heat

Chorus x
We eat the night we drink the time
 Make our dreams come true
 And hungry eyes are passing by
 On streets we call the zoo


Another day no peace in sight
A solution far away
The military won the war
Certainly not for you and me

How many generations will it take
To cut the stream of blood
I hear voices that spin inside my head
Its your voice that counts so much

Here comes the young the new generation
You are the only ones
You are the only ones who can make a change

The world looks kind of small from way up there
Through the window of our time
The shuttle broke into a million pieces
In the blue sky

The world is spinning round way too fast
And New York City went all dark
Theres a message that goes out tonight
From the bottom of my heart

Here comes the young the new generation
You are the only ones
You are the only ones who can make a change
Here comes the young the new generation
You are the only ones
You are the only ones who can make a change

Always hold on to your dreams
Because the world is not the same
The day your hope will die
Just carry on for you and me
Cause its the spark inside that flame
That gives your visions life

Always hold on to your dreams
Because the world is not the same
The day your hope will die
Just carry on for you and me
Cause its the spark inside that flame
That gives your visions life

Here comes the young the new generation
You are the only ones
You are the only ones who can make a change
Here comes the young the new generation
You are the only ones
You are the only ones who can make a change

We are we are the new generation
We are the only ones
We are the only ones who can make a change
We are we are the new generation
We are the only ones
We are the only ones who can make a change


Well it seems that I was lost
In intoxicated nights
Following the trace of ecstasy
With no future and no past
Just the present was alive
Like a prisoner chained on to a dream
I was drowning in a feeling
That obsession rules
till the morning kills the creatures of the night
And I read your lipstick message
On the mirror of the truth
Now that youre gone I realize
Without you
Lifes like a song without music
Without you
This world wont be the same
I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love come back and stay
Well I know that I was lost
In the nightmare of my life
Following the flash of fantasy
In a feeling that exploded
Id left reality behind
Addicted to the power of a dream
Without you
Lifes like that road that leads nowhere
Without you
The world wont feel the same
I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love come back and stay
Youre burnin my heart
Youre burnin my mind
Youre spoilin my art
Youre wasting my time
No taste in your actions
No taste in your line
No tears now
Just dont do you ever mind

You say you want to be a superstar
Youre givin up half to get that far
You say you want to ride a diamond car
But I dont like your fancy car

Hey hey hey dont you want to see
Im not your steppin stone
Hey hey hey Ive gotta be free
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone

Youre in love with success
Youre spilling my wine
No part of my address babe
Your ways arent mine
You may got the money
But your wastin my life
Im not your bugs bunny
And youre not my wife

You say you only do it for affect
But you dont want to see what I detest
I think youre depraved
Im gonna leave you so
But you cant see what I see so let me go

Hey hey hey dont you want to see
Im not your steppin stone
Hey hey hey Ive gotta be free
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone x
Walking through the desert
 You know what its about
 Its really from the church
 Too foreign
 That was never there
 Yet you know Im in heaven
 But it is a hell
 Sun is drying up my brain
 The smile and installations
 Are my pain
 Im going mad x
 Aaaayowwww

Walking through the desert
 You know what its about
 Its really from the church
 Too foreign
 That was never there
 Im goin mad
 Sun is drying out my brain
 The smile and installations
 Are my pain
 Im going mad x
 Mad


Life is empty cant remember anytime before
On a plain lit cold December see it evermore
Gliding through this life and another as a child
Ever doing games and losing things always playing gigs

Somewhere in the sky where the moon the stars shine bright
Where the sun is shining in the night
I am in disgrace yet I see your smiling face
And I hope you let me share your place

I dont live today

Rain in the sky made the world fly
Into time back beyond time
Sun in the sky made the world fly
Into time back beyond time x

Well I lived in magic solitude
Of cloudy looking mountains
And a lake made out of crystal raindrops
Roaming through space

Two thousand years ago
Ive seen the giant city of Atlantis
Sinking into eternal wave of darkness

Somewhere in the blue distance
Are those long forgotten trees of yore
A broken violin floatin alone in December
Darkness everywhere and nothing more

Symbol strange symbol melancholy
Painting torrid colors on a sky of green
Candle breathing one night only
Far away in chillness bleak unseen

Drifting galley ghostlike shadow
Sails rigged to catch and kill the time
Echoes wandering down an endless meadow
I feel sublime
Well you know it is hard
Being a long time apart
But its you that I love dont you see

And when I go away
You say please stay okay
I want you to stay only with me

Well you know it is hard
All these girls are so smart
And they see me all over the place

Well they phone me at night
Ask me out for a bite
I can see all the lust in their face

All these chicks really know
That next day I will go
And they will never see me again

So when Im back home
And we both are alone
I can feel all you love and your pain

Woman Im only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Woman Im only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Now you know how I feel
Nothing is real

Well its hard to say no
When youve done a good show
And they all want you to celebrate

Well I try to refuse
Try to make some excuse
But at this point its mostly too late

Yeah I start feeling good
And I get in the mood
I guess youll know what I mean

These chicks all around
Its so hard to keep count
Its like a schizophrenic dream

Woman Im only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Woman Im only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Now you know how I feel
Nothing is real

Well you know it is hard
Being a long time apart
But its you that I love dont you see

And when I go away
You say please stay okay
I want you to stay only with me

Well you know it is hard
All these girls are so smart
And they see me all over the place

Well they phone me at night
Ask me out for a bite
I can see all the lust in their face

Woman Im only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Woman Im only a man
Do the best that I can as you know
Now you know how I feel
Nothing is real x
Out for a thrill
 Got time to kill
 Just livin up my dreams
 For heavens sake
 Shes on the make
 A twisted vicars queen
 And then one night we took a ride
 She was all over me
 Outrageous
 Just aint real
 I was too wasted to see

Before you get in too deep
 And you get burned by the heat
 Oh yeah
 Shell take you there
 You know it happened to me

Shell make your heart break
 Shell give you fever
 Shell tell you everything but dont believe her
 A perfect stranger
 She knows the game
 Shell promise heaven on earth
 But dont believe her

Out on the street of broken dreams
 Where no one ever wins
 Just when you thought youd made a start
 Youre back where you begin

Before you get in too deep
 And you get burned by the heat
 Oh yeah
 Shell take you there
 I think you know what I mean

Shell make you crazy
 Shes such a teaser
 Says youre the only one but dont believe her
 She deals in danger
 The girls insane
 Shell promise heaven on earth
 But dont believe her

Before you get in too deep
 And you get burned by the heat
 Oh yeah
 Shell take you there
 You know it happened to me

Dont believe her Dont believe her
 Dont believe her Dont believe her
 Dont believe her Dont believe her
 I cant believe her Dont believe her

Shell make your heart break
 Shell give you fever
 Shell tell you everything but dont believe her
 A perfect stranger
 She knows the game
 Shell promise heaven on earth

Shell make you crazy
 Shes such a teaser
 Says youre the only one but dont believe her
 She deals in danger
 The girls insane
 Shell promise heaven on earth
 But dont believe her

Dont believe her x


She was born with a song in the air 
 In the summer of 
 The clouds just went and the day became so bright 
 A child of love angel like 
 With the most beautiful smile 
 Growing up to be the sunshine of my life 

Come talk to me 
 Dont run away 
 Dont let the distance grow 
 The doors wide open 
 Dont ever think 
 There is no way home 

Sly come home tonight 
 The world is so bad you drive em all mad 
 With your smile 
 Sly my joy and my pride 
 When the runaway train took you away 
 A part of me died 

The years went by like the summer of love 
 So much changed in our lives 
 Theyre too may scars deep under my skin 
 Love turned to hate and hate to love 
 Lets start all over again 
 And now I wonder what life will bring 

Just let us laugh 
 The tears away 
 No more hard feelings no 
 Cause after all 
 Youre my flesh and blood 
 I dont want you to fall 

Sly come home tonight 
 The world is so bad you drive em all mad 
 With your smile 
 Sly come home alive 
 When the runaway train took you away 
 A part of me died

Welcome to a trip
Into my hurt feelings
To the center of my soul
You better bring a light
To find the house of meanings
In the labyrinth of yeas or no
For you life is just like chess
If you dont make a move
Youll lose the game like this

Cause you youre walking on the edge
You you chose the way of love and pain
You dont you see the bridge
Ive built for you its just one step to start again

Welcome to a trip
Into my emotions
To the language of my heart
Youre sailing on a river
That becomes an ocean
Which you can only cross with love
For you life is just like chess
If you dont make a move
Youll lose the game like this

Cause you youre walking on the edge
You you chose the way of love and pain
You dont you see the bridge
Ive built for you its just one step to start again


A Gstring is looking for a pilot
White flesh is coming down the stairs again
Your look just makes me a believer
Stray cats are landing in a rain storm
Crashed down lost in wango tango land
Spaced out your body gives me fever
You sex it
Relax it
Reload it
You want it freshly squeezed
Closed down the road of all restrictions
Mad dogs are tearing down the roof again
Sweet noise is pouring from the speakers
Last dance Im drowning in the moonlight
Exit is the door that I cant find
Black out it cant get it any deeper
You sex it
Relax it
Reload it
And never hold it
You slash it
Refresh it
Reload it
You want it fresh
Got no diamonds rings
But a song to sing
Just to make you fly
Beggar or a king
Well sitting on a stone
Sitting all alone
Sticky things are rolling down the mountain
Well see the lonesome tramp
Whos living in the damp
Nobodys in the valley

Shine on shine on Sun oh its so cold right here
Shine on shine on Sun shine on all night long

Daydreams are of silent blue
Icy wings will carry you
Midnight Sun will never shine
Just ravings of a fool you think
And laugh about him all the time 

Shine on shine on Sun oh its so cold right here
Shine on shine on Sun shine on all night long

White pale velvet Autumn Sun will fade away
Forgotten life will finish now in endless grey
Some days are drifting haze
Some days are glowing blaze
Some days are tides of life

Staggerin along a tropic highway
Crazy lights are whirling round and round
Hell or heaven Night or Day
Burning fingers push the Sun away

Shine on shine on Sun
Only the Lord knows the answer
To the mess this world is in
At the end of the rainbow
Were scared to death once again

Lifes getting shorter every hour
It keeps on feeding in my face
Why cant we stop the evil power
That will kill the human race

Right baby dont cry
Keep on dancing tonight
On the edge of time

Right baby dont cry
Keep on dancing tonight
On the edge of time

Only the Lord knows the answer
To the mess this world is in
This place has turned into Atlantis
And its already started to sink

Life in the fast lane
Has turned into a dead end street
Lets turn the wheel back to the future
Lets use the power of our dreams

Right baby dont cry
Keep on dancing tonight
On the edge of time
You wake up 
 Watch the world go round 
 You shiver 
 Feeling upside down 
 Your heart is beating fast 
 Pumping blood to your head 
 Another day to fight 
 You have a prayer on your lips under the desert sun 
 And a loaded gun 

You remember every word 
 That your father said 
 Stay out of trouble son 
 And be true to yourself 
 Youll be working like a dog 
 Raise a family 
 And life will be alright 
 But now its written in the stars 
 If youll make it out alive 
 Out alive 

The good die young 
 There might be no tomorrow 
 In god we trust 
 Through all this pain and sorrow 
 The good die young 
 The flame will burn forever 
 And no one knows your name 
 Bring the boys back home again 

It was a quiet day 
 On the streets of hope 
 When the bomb went off 
 At the side of the road 
 Sounds of breaking steel 
 An windshield full of blood 
 No enemy in sight 
 It feels like in a movie scenes are passing by 
 Its your life

The Good Die Young

You wake up
Watch the world go round
You shiver
Feeling upside down
Your heart is beating fast
Pumping blood to your head
Another day to fight
You have a prayer on your lips
Under the desert sun
And a loaded gun

You remember every word
That your father said
Stay out of trouble son
And be true to yourself
Youll be working like a dog
Raise a family
And life will be alright
But now its written in the stars
If youll make it out alive
Out alive

The good die young
There might be no tomorrow
In god we trust
Through all this pain and sorrow
The good die young
The flame will burn forever
And no one knows your name
Bring the boys back home again

It was a quiet day
On the streets of hope
When the bomb went off
At the side of the road
Sounds of breaking steel
An windshield full of blood
No enemy in sight
It feels like in a movie
Scenes are passing by
Its your life
I keep on dancin on the roof
 Try not to fall stay in the groove
 A step too far Im out of place
 Life beats you up some of these days
 Just like a whisper theres a voice
 Inside of me
 Its sayin You aint got a choice
 Cant you see
 Ooh when your world comes tumbling down
 Ooh you better find a way around

I keep on walkin in the clouds
 Find out what life is all about
 I keep on runnin away from here
 To learn the grass aint greener there
 Just like a whisper theres a voice
 Inside of me
 Its sayin You aint got no choice
 As you can see
 Ooh when your world comes tumbling down
 Ooh you better find a way around
 Ooh cause no one else but you
 Ooh can find the stone inside your shoe

Ooh when your world comes tumbling down
 Ooh you better find a way around
 Ooh cause no one else but you
 Ooh can find the stone inside your shoe
 Inside your shoe
 Inside your shoe
 Inside your shoe
 Yeah

Keep rockin in the street
 Keep landing on your feet
 Keep runnin on and on
 Still play my favorite blond
 Keep rockin mother earth
 Just all around the world
 These days mean safer sex
 Get my survival pack
 My orgasm isnt faked
 Ooh Lord I need a break
 And whats annoying too
 Is that damn thing in my shoe
 Ooh there is a stone in my shoe


You know nothing about loving
You lost somewhere down the line
You know nothing about giving
You should draw the line

You keep looking out for something
Something youre never gonna find
When will will you show your feelings
You will lose your mind

Whos to blame my love
You play a dangerous game
Whos to blame my love
All you want is money and fame

You play play with emotions
You need need a stepping stone
Youre out out for sensations
Dont you dont you feel alone

Whos to blame my love
You play a dangerous game
Whos to blame my love
All you want is money and fame

Money and fame
Money and fame
Money and fame



Met her down at that Tokyo place
Loved her pretty face
I said Hey youre alright so alright
I was sitting in her car
She told me Youre a star 
And I know you

She said Take me home
I need love so strong
Come on and knock me out oh
Ive been too long alone
I want hot love you know 
And I need it now

She said 
Hey lets go dont put on a show
Youre just another piece
Another piece of meat
She said 
Hey lets go
Dont put on a show
Youre just another piece 
Another piece of meat

Next day she took me out
To a rough kick boxing show
Violence really turned her on oh no
She was screaming for more blood
Loved it more than any drug
I couldnt stand it

I said
Hey lets go 
Dont put on a show
Youre just another piece 
Another piece of meat
Said
Hey lets go 
Dont put on a show
Youre just another piece 
Another piece of meat
Grave communication
See me this is my life
Im the grazier of a new reservation
Do you feel
The floor vibration
Cause men everywhere
Could use the greatest scientific creation

And I say Oooh Oooh Im a robot man
And I say Oooh Oooh Im a loser
I say Oooh Oooh Im a robot man
I lost my mind
I lost my life
I lost myself

Babe its a magic
What we live what we do
With our magic from my generation
I say Babe its not a 
Its reality
Cause its a robot time that we live in

And I say Oooh Ooh Im a robot man
And I say Oooh Ooh Im a loser
I say Oooh Ooh Im a robot man
I lost my mind
I lost my life
I lost myself

And I say Oooh Ooh Im a robot man
And I say Oooh Ooh Im a loser
And I say Oooh Ooh Im a robot man
I say Oooh Ooh Im a loser
And I say Oooh Ooh Im a robot man
And I say Oooh Ooh Im a loser


Im lost

Woman leave my life
 Woman be so kind
 Woman well you know
 Well you know
 Yeah well you know

Zero in returns
 Zero shes my girl
 Woman well you know
 Well you know
 Yeah well you know

Blood rains down across the tundra
Ice flows through my veins
As my life drains
Northern bound my dogs are dying
But I still know
That nothing is impossible

I can feel Im getting stronger the longer
Im pushed to the limit
Said Id do it someday
Someday is now
When I see the world around me receding
No time for bleeding
Show the world how
Someday is now

Eight steps till I reach the summit
My line breaks and I fall down
The rocky terrain
My bones are broken into pieces
My mind cant wait
To get up and do it again

I can feel Im getting stronger the longer
Im pushed to the limit
Said Id do it someday
Someday is now
When I see the the sun is shining Im flying
Theres no time for crying
Im gonna win someday

No turning back no more yesterdays
I just wont get lost in the haze
All my tomorrows no sadness no sorrow
Watch out for the rest of my days

Stronger the longer
Im pushed to the limit
Said Id do it someday
Someday is now
When I see the the sun is shining Im flying
Theres no room for crying
Im gonna win some way
Someday is now




You never take the easy way
 The wind is blowing straight into your face
 You never ever close your eyes
 For any trouble that may cross your way
 Theres no risk that youre not taking
 Not a mountain thats too high
 Spread your wings youre gonna make it
 To the best time of your life

Dont stop at the top
 Touch the sky before you drop 

You never make a compromise
 Your will has got the power that wont break
 You never say never to a challenge
 That will come along the way
 Theres no risk that youre not taking
 Not a mountain thats too high
 Spread your wings youre gonna make it
 To the best time of your life

Dont stop at the top
 Touch the sky before you drop 

Never stop Dont stop at the top


In the heat of the violence
 The nights exploding everywhere
 When hate pulls the trigger
 The devil comes to take his share
 In the Garden of Eden
 The time is running out so fast
 Into the heart of the demon
 With no escape our die is cast

In the city of angels
 Death is just a moment away
 In the city of angels
 Your future wont see the light of the day

Beware of the alien nation
 Beware of the truth that they seek
 They pray for eternal salvation
 They pray for your soul to keep

On the eve of destruction
 A reign of terror rules the street
 When the heads start rolling
 The devil comes to let it bleed

In the city of angels
 Death is just a moment away
 In the city of angels
 Your future wont see the light of the day

Walk on past the alien nation
 Walk on to the end of your reach
 No fear of the alien nation
 No fear of the hatred they preach

Dont run 
 Theres no place to hide
 Today or tomorrow it will get you
 Dont move
 The knife is right at your throat
 And whatever you do
 Theres no way out
 When the shroud comes down on this place
 To bury us all alive
 Well know the time has come
 To face the heat

Beware of the alien nation
 Beware of the truth that they seek
 They pray for eternal salvation
 They pray for your soul to keep
 Walk on past the alien nation
 Walk on to the end of your reach
 They pray for your eternal damnation
 They pray for your soul to keep


Im in love with the sunshine
Im in love with the fallin rain
Everything seems to call your name
Yesterday you were leavin
Leavin life and all your pain
Everything wants you back again
Wants you back again
Wants you back again

I found myself through you
And there was love in my life
I felt there was nothing to hide
And my love had a home
But now my mind has started to roam
Youre my life giving fire
And you carry all my love
Through you I was so inspired
Youre engraved deep in my heart
Heart heart heart 

My dreams recall us being warm
Ive searched for you to be free
The force of life you have always been
I feel blue since youre gone
Youre breath of life surrounded me
When can I join you to be free
Join you to be free
Join you to be free

Wait can this be a dream
There is a voice in my head
It belongs to you it says
Dont cry no need to be sad
Theres a way to stay with you again
Its more than you ever had
And though death brings us apart
Our timeless love always grows
Because you are my other part

I know weve never been apart
Your love sets fire to my heart
Well burn the sky
When its time for me to die
Well burn the sky oh yeah
Well burn the sky oh yeah
When its time time time
Well burn the sky
Well burn the sky oh yeah




Well Burn the Sky
Im in love with the sunshine
 Im in love with the fallin rain
 Everything seems to call your name

 Leavin life and all your pain
 Everything wants you back again
 Wants you back again
 Wants you back again

I found myself through you
 And there was love in my life
 I felt always naturally high
 And my love had a home
 But now my mind has started to roam
 Youre my life giving fire
 And you carry all my love
 Through you I was so inspired
 Youre engraved deep in my heart
 Heart heart heart

My dreams recall us being one
 Ive searched for you to be free
 The force of life you have always been

 Youre breath of life surrounded me

If you say were falling 
Its gonna be on our feet 
Were gonna take it to town
Well ride the dark side of the street

If you think were not fighting
Like we used to do
So are you ready for this
You might learn a bit a trick or two

Cause all those years of rockin hard
Have taught us how to rise and how to fall
And were still standing tall

Were going out with a bang
Were going out with a bang
I said we gonna go out with a bang
Bang bang bang
Out with a bang

If you say were losing
Watch out were taking the crown
Thumbs go up all the way
No sign of slowing down

If you think were exited
I cannot tell you how much
Cause lifes a heartbeat away
And were never losing touch

Cause all those years of rockin hard
Have taught us how to rise and how to fall
Were standing tall
When Im alone Im feeling blue
 Dreaming a dream of a world thats lovely and true

Faintly the dream of a true and wonderful world
 And no one will care as long as the world will turn
 x

And I know a place to go to find my peace of mind
 And I know a place to find my peace of mind

And I try x


Heroes dont cry
Heroes dont cry

Standing here in front of you
A wave of joy and sadness fills the room
Your soul has crashed into a wall
Your world just broke to pieces after all

The days of your life
Leave the world standing outside
But you find the strength for a smile
Because heroes like you wouldnt cry

Heroes dont cry
Heroes dont cry

The judge decided its your right
To wake up from the dream of your life
The curtain is about to fall
No need for words your eyes just say it all

The days of your life
Leave the world standing outside
You find the strength for a smile
Because heroes like you wouldnt cry

Heroes dont cry

There are days of your life
Leave the world standing outside
You find the strength for a smile
Because heroes like you wouldnt cry

Heroes dont cry

I cant forget that afternoon
So many times Ive been thinking of you
Im happy that youve decided to live
And what touches me most is what you said
Heaven can wait can wait can wait

We are in the ocean
 Every kind of fish
 We are a human rainbow
 We are whatever we wish
 We have been forever
 And we shall always be

 Always high on emotion

 Weve had our days of doubt
 Some things weve learnt to live with
 Some things we live without
 We got no time for waiting
 We got no sacred cows
 For there is no tomorrow
 Theres only here and now

And the spirit of rock will never die
 Just like a rock in the ocean
 In the spirit of rock were flying high
 A million miles high on emotion
 The spirit of rock will never die

I swear Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

Five days a week
 Keep the spirit alive
 Eight days a week
 Forever saturday night

Sitting alone in the dark house
Thinking of you all the time
Sighing crying
Sitting alone in the dark house
Thinking of you all the time
Sighing crying
Aaaaah
Aaah
Dark Lady

Sitting alone by the window
Counting the stars of the night
Waitin hatin
Sitting alone by the window
Counting the stars of the night
Waitin hatin
Aaaaah
Aaah

Sitting and watching the sunrise
Darkness is filling my eyes
Sighing crying

Let me tell you something
 In the darkness of the room
 Im leaning back against the wall
 Try to walk on broken glass
 A cut so deep just hurts so bad
 I remember what you said
 Tears were rollin down your face
 And after alls been said and done
 Youre a woman Im a man
 Could I turn back the time again
 You must know by now
 I wont let you down
 Whatever comes along the way
 Dont you agree that one thing is true
 Im not the best but the best for you

And I step outside the door
 Blinded by a million lights
 In the valley of the fools
 Another day went by so fast
 What in the world will ever last
 You must know by now
 I wont let you down
 Whatever comes along the way
 Dont you agree that one thing is true
 Im not the best but the best for you
 Theres nothin else that we have got
 But our love is like a rock
 Standing up against the tide

Theres nothin else that we have got
 But our love is like a rock
 Standing up against the tide
 You must know by now
 I wont let you down
 Whatever comes along the way
 Dont you agree that one thing is true
 Im not the best but the best for you
 You must know by now
 I wont let you down
 Whatever comes along the way
 Dont you agree that one thing is true
 Im not the best but the best for you

Dont you agree that one thing is true
 Im not the best but the best for you
 Im not the best but the best for you
 Im not the best but the best for you


Im still living for tomorrow
Im living for today

Lets make this world
A better place to live
Start to take
Start to give

Loves got the power
To get it done
To stop the pain
Of a killing gun

And even if you say
Were gonna die today
Im still living for tomorrow
Im living for today
Cause love will find a way my friend
Whatever it will take
Im still living for tomorrow
Im living for today
Why dont we try today my friend
To make this world a better place

Lets make this life
A better life to live
Stop to hate
Learn to forgive
Even power can kill
The human race
If we gave life
A human face a human face

And even if you say
Were gonna die today
Im still living for tomorrow
Im living for today
Cause love will find a way my friend
Whatever it will take
Im still living for tomorrow
Im living for today
Why dont we try today my friend
To make this world a better place a better place 


Im still living for tomorrow

Another morning such as ordinary day
Shes doin time from nine to five
The hours waste away
Theres no escape shes a part of the bog machine
Shes a slave to the suit and tie
Seven days a week

But every night
She can hardly wait
It feels alright
To give it all away

Good girls get their kicks after six
Good girls get their kicks after six
She needs it bad real real bad
She wants what she never had
All the things that make a good girl bad
She gets her kicks after six

Some days its hard to face the cruel reality
Just waitin for the bell to ring
She wants to be free
It feels so good to start another endless night
She spreads her wings for another flight
Shes running wild

But every night
She can hardly wait
It feels alright
To give it all away

Good girls get their kicks after six
She needs it bad real real bad
Good girls get their kicks after six
Ooh yeah shake it for me baby
She wants what she never had
All the things that make a good girl bad
She gets her kicks after six 
I cant believe what the people say
Theres only hate everywhere
So many people go different ways
So many things dont you care

They see nobody they see themselves
But a stage like in a show
They see the hell and they need your help
They need your help they need love love

This is my song
I tell you about the story of love
This is my song
I tell you about the story of love

This is my song
I tell you about the story of love
This is my song
I tell you about the story of love

I think I need you you need me too
The place where we live is here
The world is griping what can I do
For you and you everywhere

I sing this song bout the world of love
And hope you hear what I say
Forever freedom forever love
Forever love everyday
Kick your ass to heaven
With rockn roll tonight
Ill make this night a special one
Make you feel alright
Shoot my heat into your body
Give ya all my size
Im gonna beat the beat tonight
Its time to break the ice

Dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite

Hit the top together
Get ya with my spell
Im gonna make my shot tonight
Take you down to hell
Eat your meat until youre breathless
Twirl your hips around
Im gonna break my neck tonight
Ill get you off the ground

Dynamite
Youre dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite

Get it now or never
Lets get it really tight
Well make this night a special one
Make us feel alright
Put your heat into my body
Give ya all my size
We gonna beat the beat tonight
Come on lets break the ice

Dynamite
Youre dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite
Youre dynamite
Dynamite 
You baby you baby
Youre dynamite
Theyre days that make you fly
 Theyre days you wanna cry
 Sometimes the walls come tumbling down
 Theyre moments in the dark
 When pain just floods your heart
 And you surrender one more time
 Take a walk out in the rain
 With every drop that falls
 Know the sun will shine again

Theyre days youre naturally high
 Theyre days you wanna die
 Sometimes your world goes down in flames
 Theyre moments deep in love
 But when it breaks your heart
 You just surrender one more time
 Take a walk out in the rain
 With every step you make
 Learn that life means constant change

Tomorrows all that counts
 Life goes round n round
 You gotta draw the line
 Goodbye yesterday
 Tomorrows all that counts
 Life goes round n round
 And if you keep the faith
 Time will call your name

Take a walk out in the rain
 With every breath you take
 Feel your soul is free again
 Tomorrows all that counts
 Life goes round n round
 You gotta draw the line
 Goodbye yesterday
 Tomorrows all that counts
 Life goes round n round
 And if you keep the faith
 Time will call your name
 Tomorrows all that counts
 Life goes round n round
 You gotta draw the line
 Goodbye yesterday


A moment of glory called evolution
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child
A new beginning a moment of freedom
Like angels are singing a song full of joy

This side of heaven
Belongs to the children
I will be there when the future arrives

A moment of glory called evolution
Could I fly away like a bird in the sky
No limitation a new inspiration
A World that is free just as free as my mind

Communication
A new destination
The planet of visions is calling tonight

Another thousand years seem so long
Im just a passenger
And the ride has just begun

Moment of glory
A moment of glory called evolution
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child
A new beginning a moment of freedom
Like angels are singing a song full of joy

This side of heaven
Belongs to the children
I will be there when the future arrives

Moment of glory
I saw this girl walking down the street
I thought oh yeah she looks rather neat
I grabbed my chance and played my usual game
I tell you man it can be a strain

She didnt wanna know what id got to say
Just shook her head and looked the other way
And then she said ive met your type before
For me youre all the same youre such a bore

Oh no dont make no promises
Oh no your body cant keep

Next day can you believe she was at the show
She said hey man youre great and she took me home
She started to undress what a shock to see
Padded bra blonde wig not much left for me

Oh no dont make no promises
Oh no your body cant keep

Oh no dont make no promises
Oh no your body cant keep

Oh no dont make no promises
Oh no your body cant keep

Oh no dont make no promises
Oh no your body cant keep
You can always trust 
Your inner feelings 
cause they always tell the truth 
Where did it get you then your analyzing 
Just do what feels right for you 

If you take life as a crazy gamble 
Throw your dice take your chance 
You will see it from the different angle 
And you too can join the dance 

Make it real not fantasy 
Fantasy 
Make it real not fantasy 
Fantasy oooh yeah 

Did you ever have a secret yearning 
Dont you know it could come true 
Nows the time to set wheels turning 
To open up your life for you 

As you know theres always good and evil 
Make your choice dont be blind 
Open up your mind and dont be trivial 
Theres a whole new world to find 

Make it real not fantasy 
Fantasy 
Make it real not fantasy 
Fantasy oooh yeah 

Did you ever have a secret yearning 
Dont you know it could come true 
Nows the time to set wheels turning 
To open up your life for you 

If you take life as a crazy gamble 
Throw your dice take your chance 
You will see it from a different angle 
And you too will join the dance 

Make it real not fantasy 
Fantasy

Have you ever seen the morning
When the sun comes up the shore
And the silence makes
A beautiful sound
Have you ever sat there waiting
For the time to stand still
For all the world to stop
From turning around

And you run
Cause life is too short
And you run
Cause life is too short

Have you ever seen the glowing
When the moon is on the rise
And the dreams are close
To the ones that we love
Have you ever sat there waiting
For heaven to give a sign
So we could find the place
Where angels come from

And you run
Cause life is too short
And you run
Cause life is too short
And you run
Cause life is too short
And you run
Cause life is too short

Theres a time that turns
Id turn back time
But I dont say I can
It only works if you believe in the truth
Well theres a time to live
And a time to cry
But if youre by my side
I will try to catch a star
Ill try to catch a star
Just for you

And I run
Cause life is too short
And I run
Cause life is too short
And I run
Cause life is too short
And I run
Cause life is too short

Too short
Too short
Life is too short

Too short
Too short
Life is too short



Life Is Too Short

Have you ever seen the morning
When the sun comes up the shore
And the silence makes

Have you ever sat there waiting
For the time to stand still
For all the world to stop

And you run
Cause life is too short

Take your hand and you take my hand
Lets try to learn to fly
Hear what I say hear what I say
Dream and close your eyes

Too much hate
Too much hate
So many things are wrong
So many ways so many ways
Flying through the sky forever
Into another time

Yesterday so far away
Many miles together
Were looking for a way

Day by day
So far away
All the world
To do the same

So we go together
Will you show me the way
Time has gone
It has gone

Far away far away

And today
Ill see a way
Follow me we love you
Just listen what I say

Forget your name and yesterday
Put out your hand
Ill do the same

Now were going to another land
Will you show me the way
Time has gone
It has gone far away
Far away
Test the mend devil melt
Bloody money when its lent
Scum repair everywhere
They want money oh

Heavenly wont it be
Heres some money
Belong to thee
I will pay they will say
Give your money oh

Obligator came and said to me
Why dont you pay your debt
The debt that you amend
Asking him forgive on his demand
For I am with a mate
Despite in her return
Remittance of the debt
I cant accept
He told me and he capped
Quite time on his demand

Imaginations came into my brain
Cause if you patients came
That brings me in my break

Test the mend devil mend
Bloody money when its lent
Scum repair everywhere
They want money oh
Girl I dont think of you

And I just miss those days
Our secret little place oh well oh

Cause it feels so good to be your lover
Feels so good to be your lover
When my lips are kissing you all over
Lips are kissing you all over
And no matter what I do

Theres nothing left to do
But to say those words to you
Oh yes I do
Just when you make your way back home
I find some time to be alone
I go to see the place once more
Just like a thousand nights before
I climb the stage again this night
Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down

This is the place where I belong
I really love to turn you on
Ive got your sound still in my ear
While your traces disappear
I climb the stage again this night
Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down

Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down

I just happen to be in it for a while 

Oh youre lovin me to death
Youre killin me with kindness 
Whats behind this sudden tenderness 

Youre lovin me to death
And leavin me to die
You make me wanna scream
But my tongue is tied
You played me like a toy
You made my life a mess
Everybody knows
Youre lovin me to death 

When you touch
Can you feel
Is your heart 
Only made of steel
When you cry 
Do you ever let emotions
Break your stride 

Oh you take away my breath
Your unexpected hunger
Makes me wonder 
What the hell comes next 

Youre lovin me to death
And leavin me to die
You make me wanna scream
But my tongue is tied
You played me like a toy
You made my life a mess
Everybody knows
Youre lovin me to death 

Youre lovin me to death
And leavin me to die
You make me wanna scream
But my tongue is tied
You played me like a toy
You made my life a mess
Everybody knows
Youre lovin me to death

Youre lovin me to death
And leavin me to die
You make me wanna scream
But my tongue is tied
You played me like a toy
You made my life a mess
Everybody knows
Youre lovin me to death


I saw the morning
It was shattered by a gun
Heard a scream saw him fall no one cried
I saw a mother
She was praying for her son
Bring him back let him live dont let him die

Do you ever ask yourself
Is there a heaven in the sky
Why cant we get it right

cause we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon
Then why why cant we live as one

I saw the evening
Fading shadows one by one
We watch the lamb lay down to the sacrifice
I saw the children
The children of the sun
How they wept how they bled how they died

Do you ever ask yourself
Is there a heaven in the sky
Why cant we stop the fight

cause we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon
Then why why cant we live as one

Sometimes I think Im going mad
Were loosing all we had and no one seems to care
But in my heart it doesnt change
Weve got to rearrange and bring our world some love

And does it really matter
If theres a heaven up above
We sure could use some love

cause we all live under the same sky
We all look up at the same stars 
Then why why cant we live as one

cause we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon
We all live under the same sky
We all look up at the same stars
Then why tell me why cant we live as one



Under the Same Sun

I saw the morning
 It was shattered by a gun
 Heard a scream saw him fall no one cried
 I saw a mother
 She was praying for her son
 Bring him back let him live dont let him die

Do you ever ask yourself
 Is there a heaven in the sky
 Why cant we get it right

cause we all live under the same sun
 We all walk under the same moon
 Then why why cant we live as one

I saw the evening
 Fading shadows one by one
 We watch the lamb lay down to the sacrifice
 I saw the children
 The children of the sun
 How they wept how they bled how they died

Do you ever ask yourself
 Is there a heaven in the sky
 Why cant we stop the fight

cause we all live under the same sun
 We all walk under the same moon
 Then why why cant we live as one

Sometimes I think Im going mad
 Were loosing all we had and no one seems to care we run we run
 But in my heart it doesnt change
 Weve got to rearrange 
 And bring our world some love

SOLO

And does it really matter
 If theres a heaven up above
 We sure could use some love

cause we all live under the same sun
 We all walk under the same moon
 Then why tell me why cant we live as one

cause We all live under the same sky
 We all look up at the same stars
 We all live under the same sun
 We all walk under the same moon

Then why tell me why cant we live as one



Youre a rockn roll star
Youre out of the charts
Your glorys cold youre getting old
But your life is rockn roll

Your crazy rockn roll band
Is spinning in your head in your head
Each generation makes us stars
As the first five on the charts

Aaaah Ah
And be on Top Of The Bill

You old rockn roll star
You made the best five on the charts
You had glory entertained
Rockn roll was your game

Aaaah Ah
And be on top of the bill


I look in your eyes I really think youre fooling me
Youre pretty and nice it doesnt matter dont you see
Cause I falling in love it happens to me every day
Im falling in love love just seems to slip away

Chorus x
Im falling in love
Oh oh

Dont tell me your lies I dont believe a word you say
You do realize I move around from day to day
And Im falling in love it happens to me every day
Im falling in love love just seems to slip away

Chorus x
Im falling in love
Oh oh
I was born from the sound of the strings 
For someone to give everything
To be a song just for your feeling
Close your eyes and Ill try to get in
To waken your heart like the spring 
cos I was born to touch your feelings

Steal the time take a song and be glad 
Be free as the birds dont be sad
Your time will come Ill make you feel it
Youre still young like the sun after rain
Follow the light its not in vain
And you will see Ill touch your feelings

Youve got your songs they are everyday
For a while just the only way 
To feel alright

You were born just to lose or to win
To be someones child in the wind
To live between your mind and feelings
Find your way check it out learn each day
Follow the light its not in vain
And you will see Ill touch your feelings

Youve got your songs they are everyday 
For a while just the only way 
To feel alright

Shes the one thats what I thought
When our love had just begun
But times have changed
And Is better go
Because its gonna be too late
And all my love will turn to hate
Youve always known
That music is my life
And I live just for rock n roll
No one can make me change my mind
Cause I just want to live my life

Alright dont want me to stay
Alright have it your way
Alright Im leaving tonight
Alright woman Ill get out of your sight

Youre still the one
But youve shown me
How independent youve become
Dont tell me you need you need me
To be your ever faithful strong lovin man
Dont tell me Im wrong
I gotta go my way
And youll see where I belong
You live your life and I live mine
I bet you will turn out fine

Alright dont want me to stay
Alright have it your way
Alright Im leaving tonight
Alright woman Ill get out of your sight x
In the night there is
A gentle voice of silence
So low and quiet
Shell catch me cos Ive been longing

I want to walk in your park
Cos Im alone
I want to walk in your heart
Where are you I dont know

I look around and see
The sunshine in the morning
Shadows in the night 
Like angels by your side in the alley

On my journey I change the time
Leave everything behind me
Shadows in the night 
Like angels by your side in the alley

I want to walk in your park
Cos Im alone
I want to walk in your heart
Where are you I dont know

Let me walk let me walk in your heart


I close my eyes 
 Only for a moment and the moments gone
 All my dreams 
 Pass before my eyes a curiosity

Dust in the wind 
 All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song 
 Just a drop of water in an endless sea
 All we do crumbles to the ground 
 Though we refuse to see

Dust in the wind 
 All we are is dust in the wind

Dont hang on 
 Nothing lasts forever 
 But the earth and sky
 It slips away 
 All your money wont 
 Another minute buy

Dust in the wind 
 All we are is dust in the wind

Dust in the wind 
 All we are is dust in the wind

Dust in the wind 
 All we are is dust in the wind

Dust in the wind 

All we are is dust in the wind

 To the island without name

 On the island many miles away from home

 To the island many miles away from home

I saw it walking lonely down the street 
 Cool like a cat and like a crazy dream 
 Im looking twice again and cant believe 
 It turned around and then it looked at me 
 I thought oh no it really couldnt be 
 It was a man and was a woman too 
 Hes a woman 
 Shes a man

I think it really came from far away 
 Im feeling hypnotised I have to stay 
 It takes my hand and says come on lets go 
 Were going home theres nothing more to say 
 He starts to move she starts to play 
 I need a body why not you 
 Hes a woman 
 Shes a man


So here we are 
Its hour one
And its a nightmare
Theres nothing left
And yet its good to be alive
Theres no use crying
Cause the universe is not fair
The wicked and the innocent 
Are fighting to survive 

Child stay down stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child stay down stay down
You better shut your mouth 
Dont make a sound 

Human nature is the reason
For our downfall
And we deserve it playing God 
With our machines
Our religions are a prison
Thats our fatal flaw
Bombs are flying
While were sleeping with the enemy 

Child stay down stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child stay down stay down
You better shut your mouth 
Dont make a sound 

Look at me right at me
When Im telling you to stay down
Come to me run to me 
I am begging you to stay down
Cling to me desperately
All you gotta do is stay down
Pay attention my child down 

Child stay down stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child stay down stay down
You better shut your mouth 
Dont make a sound 

Child stay down stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child stay down stay down
Stay down
There was a time when we sailed on together 
 Once had a dream that we shared on the way 
 There was a place where we used to seek shelter 
 I never knew the pain of the price I would pay 

You led me on with a cloak and a dagger 
 And I didnt know you had made other plans 
 You had me believe we were meant for forever 
 I really thought my heart would be safe in your hands 

Lorelei 
 My ship has passed you by 
 And though you promised me to show the way 
 You led me astray 
 You were my lorelei 
 What kind of fool was I
 Cause I believed in every word you said 
 And now I wonder why 
 Lorelei 

There was a time when we held one another 
 Baring our souls in the light of the flame 
 Those were the days now Ive lost my illusions 
 Sometimes I wake in the night and I call out your name 

Lorelei 
 My ship has passed you by 
 And though you promised me to show the way 
 You led me astray 
 You were my lorelei 
 What kind of fool I was 
 Cause I believed in every word you said 
 And now I wonder why 
 Lorelei 

Now theres a light that shines on the river 
 Blinding my eyes from so far away 
 Shot through the heart but now I know better 
 As hard as it is to resist the song that you play 

Lorelei

A place without a name
 Under a burning sky
 Theres no milk and honey here
 In the land of God

Someone holds a sign
 It says we are human too
 And while the sun goes down
 The world goes by

White dove
 Fly with the wind
 Take our hope under your wings
 For the world to know
 That hope will not die
 Where the children cry

Waves big like a house
 Theyre stranded on a piece of wood
 To leave it all behind
 To start again

But instead of a new life
 All they find is a door thats closed
 And they keep looking for
 A place called hope

White dove
 Fly with the wind
 Take our hope under your wings
 For the world to know
 That hope will not die
 Where the children cry

Na na
 Na na na na

Can anyone tell me why can anyone tell me why
 The children of the world the children of the world
 Have to pay the price pay another price

And now your telling me
 Youve seen it all before
 I know thats right but still
 It breaks my heart

Well the golden lamb we sent
 Makes us feel better now
 But you know its just a drop
 In a sea of tears

White dove
 Fly with the wind
 Take our hope under your wings
 For the world to know
 That hope will not die
 Where the children cry

Na na

I realize a missed a day
 But Im too wrecked to care anyway
 I look around and see this face
 What the hell have I lost my taste
 Dont want to find out
 Just want to cut out

My head explodes my ears ring
 I cant remember just where Ive been
 The last thing that I recall
 I got lost in a deep black hole
 Dont want to find out
 Just want to cut out

x
Blackout
 I really had a blackout

I grab my things and make my run
 On the way out another one
 Would like to know before I stop
 Did I make it or did I flop
 Dont want to find out
 Just want to get out

x
Blackout
 I really had a blackout

Dont want to find out
 Just want to get out

Blackout
 I really had a blackout 


Youre like a brother just like no other
You keep the torch that eternal flame
We bought the ticket that oneway ticket
The hottest seat on the crazy train

It takes power to walk in our shoes
It takes power to walk on

We walk the borderline
Crossing those icecold waters
We jump into the fire
Riding the wildest storm

We rock the planet up to the zenith
Feel that adrenalin overload
Cant stop the fever that road fever
Its in my blood in every single bone

lt takes power to walk in our shoes
lt takes power to walk on

We walk the borderline
Crossing those icecold waters
We jump into the fire
Riding the wildest storm
Doing it now or never
We walk into the light
Bringing this baby home

Another day around the corner
There is sunshine after rain
This journey is going on forever
Home is where my heart is
And Im always on my way
I dont look back now
We dont look back now

It takes power to walk on

We walk the borderline
Crossing those icecold waters
We jump into the fire
Riding the wildest storm
Doing it now or never
We walk into the light
Bringing this baby home


I was born in a hurricane
Nothing to lose and everything to gain
Ran before I walked
Reaching for the top
Out of control just like a runaway train

I never walked on the narrow path
I always wanted what I didt have
All was not enough
Riding lady luck
Driving in the fast lane and just stepped on the gas

Cause I was raised on rock
My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone
Yeah I was raised on rock
My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul
And I was raised on rock

Shoot me up baby make me high
And hit the jackpot in the heat of the night
Wanna kiss your lips
Wanna move your hips
See my desire in your laserbeam eyes

You shake me up got me spinning round
You know whats going up must come down
Tomorrow Ill be gone
A million miles from home
The only road I know leads out of town

Cause I was raised on rock
My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone
Yeah I was raised on rock
My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul
And I was raised on rock

Growing up with the guitar men
Growing up way too fast
Follow the sound of a rock n roll band
This call will always last

Cause I was raised on rock
Stranded in this town
 My machine slows down
 To take me where the night begins
 Im playing everywhere
 Loving here and there
 I always take the chance to win
 Drove a million miles
 Gambling rules my life
 I only stop to start again

I reach out through the air
 Good look is everywhere
 Can almost touch it with my hands

Just a little luck tonight
 Will do and dreams come true
 Just a little luck tonight
 I cant stop the wheel
 That turns the ball of steel

When passion rules the game
 I aint got no control when my hearts in flames 

Im a stranger in this town
 Life takes me up and down
 Ill break the score until Im free
 Cant stop to roll the dice
 And in the morning light
 A girl like you is all I need

Dont you need some love tonight
 I do yes I do
 Dont you need some love tonight
 How can we stand the heat
 When love is all we need

When passion rules the game
 I aint got no control when my hearts in flames

Auf wiedersehen

An angel cries

You sold your soul to feed your vanity
Your fantasies and lies

You signed and sealed it
And now you gotta deal with it

Im just an ordinary man
I wasnt born to be a soldier in a foreign land
Now Im a prisoner of war
I dont know what Im fighting for
You tore me from my simple life
To die here naked

That was so cold
Cold
Just like the lies that you told
Cold
Nothing but ice in your soul
Cold
The side of you nobody knows
Cold
And everyone loves you

Too young too innocent to know
How far your master plan would go
You crucify the name of God
Is nothing sacred

Damn youre so cold
Cold
Just like the lies that you told
Cold
Nothing but ice in your soul
Cold
The side of you nobody knows
Cold
And everyone loves you

Damn youre so cold
Cold
Just like the lies that you told
Cold
Nothing but ice in your soul
Cold
The side of you nobody knows
Cold
And everyone loves you

So Cold
Cold
Just like the lies that you told
Cold
Nothing but ice in your soul
Cold
The side of you nobody knows 
Cold


In the jungle of these times
Honest loves so hard to find
In the world of video
Computers tell you what to do
The worlds devoted to the Dollar sign

Remotecontrolled and on the line
Plug in man on the rack
Waiting for a heart attack
And no chance to die

No more space for love
The world gets really tough
Cant you see the end
Twentieth Century Man

In the jungle of these times
Theres nothing left for them to buy
They look for God on the screen
Theyve got even dreammachines
They are mesmerized

No more space for love
The world gets really tough
Cant you see the end
Twentieth Century Man x
The time has come
For me to talk to you
And I dont mean
To hurt your pride
But everybody needs a friend sometimes
To make you see the light

In the game of life
The strong survive
Were on a oneway street
We gotta make it out alive
And never let em drag us down
In the game of life
We live and die
Another breath begins
Another chance to win the fight
From the moment that you hit the ground
In the game of life

Youre born to hunt
And never run away
And then youre hunted
By the prey
The wounded deer
Leaps highest to the sun
Until his day is done

In the game of life
The strong survive
Were on a oneway street
We gotta make it out alive
And never let em drag us down
In the game of life
We live and die
Another breath begins
Another chance to win the fight
From the moment that you hit the ground

Here comes the morning
Its time to play
The game of life
The game of life

In the game of life
The strong survive
Were on a oneway street
We gotta make it out alive
And never let em drag us down
In the game of life
We live and die
Another breath begins
Another chance to win the fight
From the moment that you hit the ground
Its the game of life
The game of life


Flying with the guys
 And my longing for fire
 Crying like last night
 The night which brings me higher

In search of light
 Escape the night one day
 Shes lost in time

Just miss so high
 Times passing by and I
 Im on my way

In search of light
 Escape the night one day
 Shes lost in time

Just miss so high
 Times passing by and I
 Im on my way


Rocked the place getting on the plane
Thunder and lightning on the way
The cabin crew told us to relax yeah
Perfect time for a birthday bash
And threw a party and we all crashed
Long before we were taking off to nowhere

Dancing with the moonlight
Should have been an easy flight
But once in the air
Half way there we went down
Dancing with the moonlight
Destination out of sight
And before we arrived
We were back on the ground

We came to stop and refueled the plane
Had some more vodka and cheap champagne
The stewardess looking so much better
Back in the air around midday
We were finally on our way
One hour flight but this one took forever

Dancing with the moonlight
Should have been an easy flight
But once in the air
Half way there we went down
Dancing with the moonlight
Destination out of sight
And before we arrived
We were back on the ground

We were dancing with the moonlight
Should have been an easy flight
But once in the air
Half way there we went down
Dancing with the moonlight
Destination out of sight
And before we arrived
We were back on the ground
Time is a wicked master
Put your life into its hand
Close your eyes and it will crush you
Rage only spins you faster
Its a curse born unto man 
Turns your dreams into disaster 

Save me 
Cause the worlds gonna stop
Baby 
Are you ready to rock
Come on and wake me
The final curtain will drop
Baby 
Are you ready to rock x
Tonight 

Lies its the truth Im after
Let me find it in your eyes
Quick before the moment dies
Cries in a sea of laughter
Weeping gently in my soul
Loves the only thing that matters 

Save me 
Cause the worlds gonna stop
Baby 
Are you ready to rock
Come on and wake me
The final curtain will drop
Baby 
Are you ready to rock x
Tonight 


Come on and save me 
Cause the worlds gonna stop
Baby 
Are you ready to rock
Come on and wake me
The final curtain will drop
Baby 
Are you ready to rock
Come on and shake me
Cause were in for a shock
Baby 
Were falling down from the top
Come on and take me
Were going straight to the top
Baby 
Are you ready to rock x
Tonight
Well here comes my baby 
 Shes dressed oh so cute 
 She looks a little crazy 
 In her Hollywood shoes 
 Well baby loves driving 
 In my hot brand new car 
 She thinks less than flying 
 Is not fast enough 

But when you turn upside down 
 Life aint too much fun 
 I wanted to cry 
 But the tears wouldnt come 

Here comes my baby 
 Shes the one I adore 
 Well shes a lucky lady 
 Born in a Gucci store 
 With gold cards in motion 
 And the platinum too 
 She jets across the ocean 
 A little faster than you 

But when it rains in St Barth 
 Life aint too much fun 
 I wanted to cry 
 But the tears wouldnt come 
 I wanted to cry 
 But the tears wouldnt come

Every night without you 
 I miss to have you by my side 
 Ohh so I keep waiting I keep waiting 
 I swear I never let you go again 

Well here comes my baby 
 With a Brad Pitt lookalike 
 Right through immigration 
 And straight out of my life 

Well it seems the friendly skies 
 Are pretty good fun 
 I wanted to cry 
 But the tears wouldnt come 

I wanted to cry 
 I wanted to cry 
 I wanted to cry 
 But the tears wouldnt come














You let me in but wont let me out
You hold the key to what its all about
I hear your machine just coming round the block
Just ready to go to rock around the clock

Hes an angel but no one can tell
He might be from heaven might be from hell

Youre not alone in the rock zone
You got it down down to the bone
Youre not alone in the rock zone
Youre not alone

The temperatures rising put the helmet on
This is a place where I belong
Bad girls keep a coming showing all the rest
What rocknroll girls really do best

Is she an angel or under a spell
I hear the devil ringing the bell

Youre not alone in the rock zone
You got it down down to the bone
Youre not alone in the rock zone
Youre not alone

Rock Zone
Rock Zone
Rock Zone
Rock Zone

Youre not alone
Hello again
Youve been alone awhile
And I can use a friend
Your shades are down
And Ive been waiting here for you to come around
And its not about forgiveness
Cause its all about the love anyhow

Chorus
We were born to fly
To reach beyond the sky
To carry on forever after
You and I
You keep my faith alive
With you Im not afraid
To rise and fall and face disaster
You and I
We were born to fly

Take another breath
Just close your eyes my love let nature do the rest
Open up your wings
And with the wind well rise above to higher things
Well forget about tomorrow
And well live another day today

Chorus x
We were born to fly
To reach beyond the sky
To carry on forever after
You and I
You keep my faith alive
With you Im not afraid
To rise and fall and face disaster
You and I
We were born to fly




We Were Born to FLy

Hello again
Youve been alone awhile

To reach beyond the sky
To carry on forever after

Walking through a winter night
 Counting the stars

 Memories of you are passing by
 It seems to me like yesterday
 I think you knew i couldnt stay

I see the stars theyre miles and miles away
 Like our love
 Lady starlight help me to find my love
 Lady starlight help me tonight

 Snow dances with the wind

 Help me to find my love 
 Lady starlight help me tonight

Girl its been a long time that weve been apart
Much too long for a man who needs love
I miss you since Ive been away
Babe it wasnt easy to leave you alone
Its getting harder each time that I go
If I had the choice I would stay

Theres no one like you
I cant wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things well do
I just wanna be loved by you

No one like you
I cant wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things well do
I just wanna be loved by you

Girl there are really no words strong enougha
To describe all my longing for love
I dont want my feelings restrained
Ooh babe I just need you like never before
Just imagine youd come through this door
Youd take all my sorrow away

Theres no one like you
I cant wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things well do
I just wanna be loved by you

No one like you
I cant wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things well do
I just wanna be loved by you

No one like you


 OST Supernatural  
Late at night when youre all alone
Take a ride to the danger zone
If someone wants to cut you down to size
You never argue with a loaded 

Just when youve had enough
Its really getting tough

Im ready for that hit between the eyes
Someone get me out of here alive
Im ready for that hit between the eyes
Cant you see Im much too young to die

You can feel the tension in the street
Theres no escape getting closer to the heat
You play with fire get your fingers burned
Its too late past the point of no return

Just when youve had enough
Its really getting tough

Im ready for that hit between the eyes
Someone get me out of here alive
Im ready for that hit between the eyes
Cant you see Im much too young to die

Late at night when youre all alone
Take a ride to the danger zone
If someone wants to cut you down to size
You never argue with a loaded 

Just when youve had enough
Its really getting tough

Im ready for that hit between the eyes
Someone get me out of here alive
Im ready for that hit between the eyes
Cant you see Im much too young to die 
As years are passing by
Silence becomes your friend
You see the world in a different way
Dont be afraid of getting old
Lifes still full of joy
And the beauty of the past
Is rejoicing your mind

When days are getting short
And winter comes along
Your life slows down and down
Like a rivers getting wide
And words have lost their force
You remember your morning
Fly to the endless sea

Lifes like a river in the morning
Lifes like a sea without end
Lifes like a river in the morning
Lifes like a sea without end


Wake up man its late but not too late
 Its six oclock like everyday

Get your things run and forget the rain
 Take powerpills dont miss your train

And youd like to be another
 A different guy and a better lover
 For your love for your life check your way
 And you like the RocknRoller
 A different life and Whisky Cola
 But dont be low keep your own style
 And catch your train

Dont be lazy man and work off your ass
 Hes the boss youve gotta do what he says

Catch your train run and forget those ways
 Keep it cool its not too late

And youd like to be another
 A different guy and a better lover
 For your love for your life check your way
 And you like the RocknRoller
 A different life and Whisky Cola
 But dont be low keep your own style
 And catch your train


You give me your smile
A piece of your heart
You give me the feel Ive been looking for
You give me your soul
Your innocent love
You are the one Ive been waiting for
Ive been waiting for

Were lost in a kiss
A moment in time
Forever young
Just forever just forever in love

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
Cause your love has found its way
To my heart

Ooh ahh
Ooh ahh

You make me dream
By the look in your eyes
You give me the feel Ive been longing for
I wanna give you my soul
All my life
Cause you are the one Ive been waiting for
Ive been waiting for so long

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
And the world stopped turnin round
For your love
When you came into my life
It took my breath away
Cause your love has found its way
To my heart
Into my heart

Just forever in love

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
And the world stopped turnin round
For your love
When you came into my life
It took my breath away
Cause your love has found its way
To my heart
When you came into my life

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
And the world stopped turnin round
For your love
When you came into my life
It took my breath away
Cause your love has found its way
To my heart

We took the long way
The long way home
And now its just one step to go
All those hours alone
With only thing to get you home
Will I get out of this
And all thats left for me is hope
Now all Im hoping for

Is a miracle a miracle
To see the daylight
A miracle
The skies so blue
Its a miracle a miracle
To find a new life
A miracle
To be back with you

In the darkest hours
Alone with all your fears
All you can think of
Are those happy days
So much we take for granted
But lifes a fragile thing these days
When the time is up
All youre hoping for
Youre hoping for

All I need

To be back with you
Just one more step
Were almost there
To be back with you
Under suburban skies
 Where life is bleeding
 Where concrete skies are grey
 Theres plenty of room for dreaming
 I still keep coming here
 Follow those traces
 I travel back in time
 Remember all those places
 Feels like I never left
 The houses still standing
 Down by the river where
 The dreams are never ending
 You find me
 You find me
 You find me by the river
 You find me
 You find me
 You find me where the river flows

Under the silent moon
 This industrial city
 Is heartland even though
 Lifes been not that pretty
 I still keep coming here
 To that old river
 To find my roots just where
 The future lives forever
 You find me
 You find me
 You find me by the river
 You find me
 You find me
 You find me you can find me
 By the river where dreams will never die
 By the river under suburban skies

By the river where dreams have never died
 By the river I look through childrens eyes
 You find me
 You find me
 You find me by the river
 You find me
 You find me
 You find me where the river flows

You find me
 You find me
 You find me by the river
 You find me
 You find me
 You find me where the river flows

Where the river flows
 Where the river flows
 Where the river flows


The summer day is gone
Listen to the evening wind
Singing tunes of TelAviv
Into the setting sun
You lie in twilight sleep
Dreaming colors deep
Today all life is gone

Look at the golden chalice
Flag broken on the ground
Ringing fire blazing round
Where are your friends
You see all hope
Lying broken on the slope
Today all life is gone

Have you ever listened to the evening wind
Take the chance to breathe and listen
Have a listen and you will see my friend
When its telling you the truth


When youre feeling lost and blue
 When there is no love for you
 Youll find him and its all right
 Its all right its all right

When youre feeling down and low
 When youve got no place to go
 And when no one smiles hello
 Hes by your side you know

When youre getting deaf and blind
 When you drag one leg behind
 And when youre finally gonna
 Lose your mind
 Its all right its all right
 Its all right

Cause he is by your side
 Cause he will be your guide
 Cause he will be your light
 And youre not alone youre not alone
 Youre not alone youre not alone



Your Light

When youre feeling lost and blue
 When there is no love for you
 Youll find him and its all right
 Its all right its all right

When youre feeling down and low
 When youve got no place to go
 And when no one smiles hello
 Hes by your side you know

When youre getting deaf and blind
 When you drag one leg behind
 And when youre finally gonna
 Lose your mind its all right its all right its all right

Cause he is by your side
 Cause he will be your guide
 Cause he will be your light
 And youre not alone youre not alone youre not alone youre not alone 


You have got a body to
 To make a man just lose his mind
 To give me a shiver send it down to my spine
 Its all because of

You have got a body to
 To bring a man down on his knees
 Just let me inside dont leave me begging please
 Dont ever go

Everybody knows
 That Im under the spell of your love
 Got nothing but you on my mind
 Thats the way it goes
 Its no wonder youre tearing my heart
 Simply in pieces tonight

You have got a body to
 To make a man just sell his soul
 Right to the devil I think after all
 I should have known

Everybody knows
 That Im under the spell of your love
 Got nothing but you on my mind
 Everybody knows
 And I wonder if you know it too
 I skywrite your name way up high
 In the sky in the sky in the sky

To bring a man down on his knees
 Just let me inside dont leave me begging please
 Dont ever go

Everybody knows
 That Im under the spell of your love
 Got nothing but you on my mind
 Thats the way it goes
 Its no wonder youre tearing my heart
 Simply in pieces tonight

Everybody knows
 That Im under the spell of your love
 Got nothing but you on my mind
 Everybody knows
 And I wonder if you know it too
 I skywrite your name way up high
 In the sky in the sky in the sky

Blowing cross the universe
Like a shooting star that lost its way
Looking back with no regrets
Living for what hasnt happened yet

Love em or leave em
No rhyme or reason
Break out to make out
No change in the season
Love em or leave em
Put out or get out
Simple survival
No more denial
Love em or leave em

Roller coaster flies off the track
Hits you in the face stabs you in the back
They jack your right leave nothing left
Steal you blind your mind and leave you deaf

Love em or leave em
No rhyme or reason
State of the nation
Pure intoxication
Feel the vibration
The anticipation
Simple survival
No more denial

Dont wanna waste no time
Im never losing track
Ive seen it all and so much more
But I aint seen nothing yet

Love em or leave em
No rhyme or reason
State of the nation
Pure intoxication
Feel the vibration
The anticipation
Simple survival
No more denial

Love em or leave em

You can shoot me down
You can drag me round
Girl Ill get you
It wont be long

You can smash my heart
You can trash our love
But my desire for you is much too strong

To be with you in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell
In heaven theres no cure for love that kills

You can waste my time
But you cant change my mind
I wont stop you
So just go on

You can play your games
But its all in vain
Cause my desire for you is much too strong

To be with you in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell
In heaven theres no cure for love that kills

Girl Im on fire
Heaven seems so close tonight
Girl I would die for your love
Another year is running through my veins
Some moments wasted some will remain
The days are getting shorter and I try to drown my fears
The shadows of the night slowly disappear

Another day to leave it all behind
Good morning life so beautiful and bright
Im going back in time to the days when I was young
And now it feels like life had just begun

Im on my way home on my way home
Yesterday seems long ago so long ago
Im on my way home sending postcards home
And greetings from the eye of the storm

Another night the curtains coming down
I hear the silence just screaming loud
I can see the sunrise rising from the smoke
Will you be there for me will I ever know

Im on my way home on my way home
Yesterday seems long ago so long ago
Im on my way home sending postcards home
And greetings from the eye of the storm

Rock the highway Highway Star
And bring me back just bring me back to my love

Im on my way home on my way home
Yesterday seems long ago so long ago
Im on my way home feelin high and low
And greetings from the eye of the storm

Its been way too long
Im still living in the eye of the storm
Whats the noise whos to blame
The Maserati comes unchained
Smell the power and energy
Come away come away come away

Youre the rider of the wildest storm
Live your dreams before theyre gone
Feel the spirit that sets you free
Come away come away come away

You gotta live it up theres no limit
We gotta make it theres no limit
You give it all youve got theres no limit
Reach for the sky

We gonna leave for tomorrowland
Weve got the future on our hands
A piece of heaven for you and me
Come away come away come away

You gotta live it up theres no limit
We gotta make it theres no limit
You give it all youve got theres no limit
Reach for the sky

You gotta let it go theres no limit
We gotta take it theres no limit
You leave me hot and cold theres no limit
Reach for the sky

Higher higher
Take me higher always higher
Reach for the sky



Sundays gone
Monthsre gone
Some learn theyre there
Lonesome crow
Where are they from
Where are their thoughts

No nobody knows
Or even thought
Please follow them
Will surely be said
Ooooow

Aaaah Ahahahah Ahahahah Ahahahah Ahahahah Haaaah

No nobody knows
Or even thought
Please follow them
Will surely be said
I left you once you killed me twice
Seems like the devil rolled the dice
What have you done what can we do
To make it through

Remember when life was free
As free as our minds
Wounded hearts

Thunder and lightning in the heat of the night
Some lonely highway its a hell of a ride
Turn it up to extreme let the engine scream
And leave it all behind
Thunder and lightning 
In a stormy night

The gun was pointed to my head
You walked away and I was dead
In the name of love youve turned to dust
What Ive called trust

Remember when we were young 
And innocent too
The monsters stayed behind the walls
No fears at all

Thunder and lightning in the heat of the night
Last exit my way its a hell of a ride
Turn it up to extreme let the engine scream
And leave it all behind
Thunder and lightning
In a stormy night
Mon destin inscrit en toi

Do you say a prayer when your feeling down
Do you believe that love can turn your faith around
Youre feeling high and low but you dont know what to think
The world is full of saints who live their lives in sin

Dont ask the mirror ball you better ask yourself
I think you know the answers but maybe you cant tell
Youll see it all so clear just take a look inside
The judge you build inside your heart will always be your guide

I was mesmerized and blown away
What if she would be the one to
Live and die for in an endless love

It hurts deep inside hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie
Inside it hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie

Love is blind and hard to find
Falling for her made me lose my mind
Hoping all was just a bad dream
Wishing I could travel back in time

It hurts deep inside hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie
Inside it hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie

Everybody I was talking to
All my friends confirmed its true
No one really was taken by surprise but me
I was really way too blind to see
Her betrayal the reality
When I finally opened up my eyes
The love was gone

It hurts deep inside hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie
Inside it hurts deep inside
When the truth is a lie
The yellow raven sipped the air
 Of thunder and of rain
 The yellow raven sipped the air
 Gentle lies kissing the rain

Where do you go fantastic dreambird
 Take me away to somewhere
 Take me away from here
 Where do you go fantastic dreambird
 Answer to my yearning
 Take me away from here

The firebird began to cry
 When music died away
 The firebird began to cry
 And smoke was slowly drifting by

Where do you go fantastic dreambird
 Take me away to somewhere
 Take me away from here
 Where do you go fantastic dreambird
 Answer to my yearning
 Take me away from here


Thats the stuff that turns me on
More than gold and money
I need sounds loud and rough
Like the bee the honey my love

I cant get enough

Move you legs stamp your feet
The language of your body
Is right now all I need
To understand youre ready for love

I cant get enough yeah

Burning lips the taste of life
High energy hot feelings
Heavy sounds to feel alright
And rock n roll for speed kings my love
Rock n roll for speed kings

I cant get enough
I cant get enough
We cant get enough

Yes yeah I cant get enough
We cant we cant we cant we cant get enough yeah
I cant get enough
We cant get enough
Would you care for me if I was deaf and blind
 Would you hear my voice if I was always quiet
 Would you hold my hand if I was going to fall
 Would you cry for me would you know my name at all
 Would you be there if I was on the ground
 Would you be my friend if no one was around
 Would you hold me close if I was in the cold
 Would you pray for me would you know my name at all
 Would you care would you be there
 For the soul behind the face
 Would you love me for what I am
 Would you care would you be there
 For the soul behind the face
 Would you love me for what I am

Would you care would you be there
 For the soul behind the face
 Would you love me for what I am
 Would you care would you be there
 For the soul behind the face
 Would you love me for what I am

Would you love me for what I am
 Would you love me for what I am
 Would you love me for what I am


In the temple of gods
The day had come to come together
In the early morning sun
They saw that girl that come to heaven

They ask her bout life on earth
If it was getting any better
She told em someone took her life
If they could send her back
Just one more time
She knew that someone feels so blue

Wouldnt it be nice Hold on
To spread the wings and fly Dont kill the butterfly
To see him one more time Hold on
To be a yellow butterfly Dont kill the butterfly

Hes been sitting on the bay
Lost inside a cloud of darkness
When I saw the butterfly
Dancing in the wind
The story goes
He knew that she was still so close

Wouldnt it be nice Hold on
To spread the wings and fly Dont kill the butterfly
To see him one more time Hold on
To be a yellow butterfly Dont kill the butterfly


I get up in the morning
 For my dose of the news
 Crawl right back in the sack girl
 Had enough of the truth
 Spend your dollars and rubles
 Buy a piece of the wall
 Build it up in your backyard
 Im so sick of it all

Ooh its a crazy world x

Drivin down to the city
 Doin 
 Better late than never
 Im more dead than alive
 We can find the Titanic
 Put a man on the moon
 But we cant fix out backyard
 Man we better start soon

Ooh its a crazy world x

I dont want to hear about it
 I wish it would be worlds away
 You know the more I think about it
 The more I feel we need to change
 I get up
 In a crazy crazy world
 We all live
 In a crazy crazy world
 Ooh yeah
 Its a crazy crazy world
 I gotta get out
 Of this crazy crazy world

Goin home to my baby
 Its been another hard day
 Bust my balls for the tax man
 So what else can I say
 They spent our money on missiles
 For the third world war
 Now theyre stacked in my backyard
 We dont need them no more

Ooh its a crazy world x

Der Atem kalt wie Eis
Obwohl die Erde brennt
Wo du auch bist 
da werd ich sein
Ich lebe jetzt ich lebe hier 
In dieser Welt
Ich atme durch voller Gier

Damn you slam you eat me like a menue
Take it brake it kick it to the ground
Empty hollow its so hard to swallow
Gotta know whats your size

Du bist so schmutzig und doch so schn
Ich will mich in dir verliern
Du bist so schmutzig wie weit willst Du gehn
Nur um mich zu amsiern

Du bringst mich noch einmal 
Um den Verstand
Niemand hat Dich je gesehen
Doch ich folge nur Deiner Spur
Durch Fleisch und Blut
Denn Du Du lebst in mir

Ammo slammo its gotta go blammo
Lust you bust can I ever trust you
Scare you dare you anyway I want you
Catch you grab you now

Du bist so schmutzig und doch so schn
Ich will mich in dir verliern
Du bist so schmutzig wie weit willst Du gehn
Nur um mich zu amsiern

Hard ass lard ass keep your hands of my stash
Holy stoli gotta have a stogie
Master blaster buy a jabocaster
Gotta eat your heart out now

Du bist so schmutzig und doch so schn
Oh du meine Phantasie
Du bist so schmutzig wie weit willst Du gehn
Bleib mir treu verlass mich nie

Du bist so schmutzig und doch so schn
Ich will mich in dir verliern
Du bist so schmutzig wie weit willst Du gehn
Nur um mich zu amsiern



Hey do you remember me
I finally found the strength to face
The pain you made me feel
I always held my tongue
And all the things youve done to me
Are secrets to reveal

Ill never let you do this to someone else
No I could never live with myself

How dare you use my shame
To play your wicked games
With the mask youre wearing
And now you gotta make amends
For the demons in my head
Ill nail you to the cross
The cross Im bearing

You you said youd save my soul
And sacrificed the innocence
That I will never know
Now its time that you confess
They say the devil doesnt rest
Until the truth is told

Ill never let you do this to someone else
No I could never live with myself

How dare you use my shame
To play your wicked games
With the mask youre wearing
And now you gotta make amends
For the demons in my head
Ill nail you to the cross
The cross Im bearing
The cross Im bearing

I believed in love
I believed in trust
I believed in you
You became my God
I believed in love
I believed in trust

I was young and so naive
You were God and I believed
You made me kneel
You made me feel
Like it was all my fault
But now I know it wasnt mine at all

How dare you use my shame
To play your wicked game
You gotta make amends
For the demons in my head
You held me down in chains
And made me take the blame
Ill nail you to the cross

Love of my life
Youve hurt me
Youve broken my heart
And now you leave me
Love of my life
Cant you see

Bring it back bring it back
Dont take it away from me
Because you dont know
What it means to me

Love of my life
Dont leave me
Youve taken my heart
You now desert me
Love of my life
Cant you see

Bring it back bring it back
Dont take it away from me
Because you dont know
What it means to me

You wont remember
When this is blown over
And everythings all by the way
When I get older
I will be there
At your side to remind you
How I still love you I still love you

Back bring it back
Thats bringing reborn to me
Because you dont know
What it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life



Yeah

Takes my dinner
 Drinks my beer
 Spends my money
 But I dont care

Shes my love
 Shes my dear
 Love is here
 I was there

Ahhh
 Yeah


Sometimes I walk mysterious places
Hear voices that talk without a word to say
Sometimes I hear the echoes of laughter
In the twilight of affairs and other tragedies

A halfmoon away way too close to heaven
She had the Iook but no morality
Sometimes its easy to forget only for a moment
But there are nights you regret eternally

Whatever frozen hearts can do
Will melt the ice away

How you know what its like
When good luck has changed the sides
And no sun shines in the dark and no angels
Ever hear your prayers in the night
When your fears come up your spine
When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart

When you get crushed in a house of cards
House of cards

Its so hard to find a way when life is in pieces
And the taste of a kiss is so bittersweet
Sometimes its easy to forget only for a moment
But the man wholl rise up from the ashes is no one else but me

Im standing in a waterfall
To wash the lies away

How you know what its like
When good luck has changed the sides
And no sun shines in the dark and no angels
Ever hear your prayers in the night
When your fears come up your spine
When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart
House of cards

Whatever frozen hearts can do
Will melt the ice away

House of Cards

Sometimes I walk mysterious places
Hear voices that talk without a word to say

Whatever frozen hearts can do

When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart
House of cards

Will melt the ice away

We come to you through a storm of lightning
To drive this place totally insane
Another show that really keeps us fighting
For what it takes to blow your mind away

Hey you are you ready for tonight
Can you hear me now
Let me hear you too

We come to you through a wall of thunder
Electrified by the sound of the Guitars
Hey you are you ready for tonight
Can you see me now
I wanna see you out there

We let it rock to free your energy
You let it roll come on get on your feet
We let it rock to feed your hungry dreams
You let it roll up to the ecstasy

We come to you through a burst of fire
Energized by the feedback of the crowd
Hey you are you ready for tonight
Can you feel me now
Can you feel the groove

We let it rock to free your energy
You let it roll come on get on your feet
We let it rock to feed your hungry dreams
You let it roll up to the ecstasy
Sometimes theres a time you must say goodbye
Though it hurts you must learn to try
I know Ive got to let you go
But I know anywhere you go

Youll never be far
Cause like the light of a bright star
Youll keep shining in my life
Youre gonna be right

Here in my heart
Thats where youll be
Youll be with me
Here in my heart
No distance can keep us apart
Long as youre here in my heart

Wont be any tears falling from these eyes
Cause when loves true love never dies
It stays alive forever
Time cant take away what love we had
I will remember our time together
You might think our time is through
But Ill still have you

Here in my heart
Thats where youll be
Youll be with me
Here in my heart
No distance can keep us apart
Long as youre here in my heart

I know youll be back again
And till then
My love is waiting

Here in my heart
Thats where youll be
Youll be with me
Here in my heart
No distance can keep us apart
Long as youre here in my heart

Here in my heart
Thats where youll be
Youll be with me
Here in my heart
No distance can keep us apart
Long as youre here in my heart

Fire in her eyes burn 
Perfume of the skies 
Fingers cold as ice freeze 
Devil in disguise

Well shes a shes a shes a
You know that shes a hellcat hellcat hellcat hellcat
Shes gonna scratch up your mind 
You know that guy with piccadillyeyes
Was talking to the French boy
But didnt realize
Bananalongboateating
An he tried to get a wife
But he couldnt stay alive
Well you know that lad with the rubberdad
Paints his fingers yellow blue and red
An you also know that shes a liar
Knowing only her desire 
She likes it hot she likes it humid
 She likes my cake and shes not stupid
 She likes my sugar she likes my bread
 Im ready to attack
 She comes at night when Im asleep
 Without a sound just like a thief
 She comes to crawl under my bed
 Im ready to attack

Priscilla oh Priscilla
 You last resistant chiller
 Priscilla oh Priscilla
 Tonight Im going to kill ya

She lives in my kitchen
 Down in the shade
 She likes leftovers
 And throwaways
 Im on a diet
 And she is fat
 Im ready to attack

Priscilla oh Priscilla
 You last resistant chiller
 Priscilla oh Priscilla
 Tonight Im going to kill ya

I cant do it I cant do it at all
 She turns a man into killer
 This cockroach named Priscilla
 This cockroach named Priscilla

Youre gonna be here
 Youre gonna be there
 Youre gonna be everywhere
 Im coming after you
 Im coming after you
 Youre gonna be now
 Youre gonna be then
 Youre gonna be out and in
 Im coming after you
 Im coming after you
 Youre gonna be saint
 Youre gonna be sin
 Youre gonna lose and win
 Im coming after you
 Im coming after you

Priscilla oh Priscilla
 Tonight Im going to kill ya


Im standing with the ranknfile
Im marching with the underground
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves

Let my imagination go and drop me where I feel most scared 
Snap back already giving thanks 
Im not trapped working in a sweatshop somewhere
This songs for those less fortunate 
Locked in a world where both ends arent meant to meet

Im standing with the ranknfile 
Im marching with the underground 
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves
Im standing with the ranknfile 
Im marching with the underground 
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves

Let my imagination go and drop me where I feel most scared 
Synaptic flashes in my head then total thanks again 
Im not soldiering somewhere 
This song is for the countless souls 
Who died in vain for someone elses gain

Im standing with the ranknfile 
Im marching with the underground 
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves
Im standing with the ranknfile 
Im marching with the underground 
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves

Left my birthplace for foreign streets to strange places new faces I flew
Shoeless kids stood on the corner 
Their eyes they were transfixed on you

So Im standing with the ranknfile 
Im marching with the underground
Oh my black heart worn on my sleeve 
Im standing with the ranknfile 
Im marching with the underground 
With our black hearts worn on our sleeves alright

x
Im standing with the ranknfile 
Im marching with the underground 
our black hearts worn on our sleeves
Im standing with the ranknfile 
Im marching with the underground 
our black hearts worn on our sleeves
That alarm clock ringin in your ear
Radio playing sports report cheer
But you got nothing to cheer or shout about
Just a nine to five in a lousy town

Your morning begins
With you thinkin of the cold of the street blown in your face

Your morning begins with you thinkin
One more day in this job and Im gonna scream

So stand up
And step out
Step out to the new sound

Stand up
Step out
Step out to the new sound

Hello to the manager Hello to the boss
As they sell you short and they drink your blood
You give em your heart and your very soul
Only to realize that they dont give a fuck about you

Your morning begins 
With you thinkin of the cold of the street blowing in your face

Your morning begins with you thinkin
One more day in this life and Im gonna scream

So stand up
Step out
Step out to the new sound

Stand up
Step out
Step out to the new sound

And when they try to put you down put you on your back
But you dont take that you knock em out

Stand up
Step out
Step out to the new sound

Stand up
Step out
Step out to the new sound

Stand up
Step out
Step out to the new sound

Stand up
Step out
Step out to the new sound

Stand up
Step out
Step out to the new sound
I point the finger at you 
Scream until my face is blue 
But you still hate everything

I point the finger at you 
The Beau monde through and through 
You still hate everything

Turn the lights on 
Watch them scatter 
Exterminate the idle chatter

I point the finger at you 
Until youre cold dead and blue 
But you still hate everything

If youre right it feels good to be wrong 
Raised fist and a fuck you song 
If youre right it feels good to be wrong 
Slaughtering the pigs 
How do you sleep

I point the finger at you 
You dont have a fucking clue 
But you still hate everything

I point the finger at you 
Doesnt matter what I do 
Cause you still hate everything

Turn the lights on 
Watch them scatter 
Exterminate the idle chatter

I point the finger at you 
Lie and lie until its truth 
But you still hate everything

If youre right it feels good to be wrong 
Raised fist and a fuck you song 
If youre right it feels good to be wrong 
Slaughtering the pigs 
How do you sleep

No change 
No shift 
No rest

There is no war without warriors 
How do you sleep 
How do you plead
Nailed to the cross dead for collective sin
We decide where why who and when
Build our bibles to ONLY include
The things that we believe to be divine and true

This is our right
This is our life
Everyone homogenized

Sodom Gomorrah Washington DC
Smited into oblivion with blood wrath and disease
Sheep in shepherds clothing

Allah Jesus and Muhammad
Their words have way more in common
Than the Midwest or the Middle East like to preach
Its a tragedy
Its a strategy
To prey on contrast to not indulge fact
Divide conquer and subcontract

Sodom Gomorrah Washington DC
Smited into oblivion with blood wrath and disease
Sheep in shepherds clothing
Sheep in shepherds clothing

The scriptures blind followers read
Are not as cryptic as they seem
The pages serve the sick and the poor 
Not to serve the capitalists of endless war

Sodom Gomorrah Washington DC
Smited into oblivion with blood wrath and disease
Sheep in shepherds clothing
Sheep in shepherds clothing
Sheep in shepherds clothing

Religion is the opiate of the weak

 Fields of green when the wind blows cold

The Anarchists are buzzin like bees around a hive
As protesters hit the streets with signs signs signs
The dissent of the world has filled us to the brim
But some will still cast their ballots
Based on those who live in sin

Its unbelievable
Its unbelievable to watch the system crumble
This political shakedown coming correct from the underground
This political shakedown coming correct from the underground
Weve been cut up
Weve been shut up
For far too long yeah

Pull the feeding tube out of the mouth of democracy
Televise it starving to death
Once buried in the ground
We can all breathe free
We can all breathe free

Its unbelievable
Its unbelievable to watch the system crumble
This political shakedown coming correct from the underground
This political shakedown coming correct from the underground
Weve been cut up
Weve been shut up
For far too long yeah

Its unbelievable whoa oh whoa ohoh
Its unbelievable whoa oh whoa ohoh

Policeman takes his club to a head Its unbelievable whoa oh whoa ohoh
Just like hes beating the drum
The news reporters dance like hell Its unbelievable whoa oh whoa ohoh
To the sounds

Policeman takes his club to a head Its unbelievable whoa oh whoa ohoh
Just like hes beating the drum
The news reporters dance like hell Its unbelievable whoa oh whoa ohoh

Chorus
Youve gotta die gotta die 
Gotta die for your government 
Die for your country Thats shit 
Youve gotta die gotta die 
Gotta die for your government 
Die for your country Thats shit 

Theres a Gulf War vet 
Dying a slow cold death 
And the government says 
We dont know the source of his sickness 
But dont believe what they say 
Because your government is lying 
Theyve done it before 
And dont you know theyll do it again 
A secret test government built virus 
Subject Test Group Gulf Battle Field Troops 

Chorus

First World War vets slaughtered 
By General Eisenhower 
You give them your life 
They give you a stab in the back 
Radiation agent orange tested on US souls 
Guinea pigs for Western corporations 
I never have I never will 
Pledge allegiance to their flag 
Youre getting used youll end up dead 

Chorus

I dont need you to tell me what to do 
And I dont need you to tell me what to be Fuck you 
I dont need you to tell me what to say 
And I dont need you to tell me 
What to think What to think 
What to think what to think 
Think think think

Times up

 Then they came for the socialists and I did not speak out
 Next they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out
 And then they came for me

 This is autonomy My American Dream
 Stepped over on the street Stars and stripes blinding me
 Their contagious air we breath My American Dream
 Classism the black plague Will mark your grave

 This is the second time we will not fall in line 
 No you cant stop this exodus
 No you wont stop this exodus
 No you cant stop this exodus
 No you wont stop this exodus

 A hooded prisoner on the bay These truths let freedom ring
 A child Darfur refugee Home of the free and brave
 The ghosts of war who will not sleep These truths let freedom ring
 The poor who drown in bigotry Will mark your grave

 This is the second time yeah its the second time we will not fall in line
 No you cant stop this exodus

 No you cant stop this exodus
 No you wont stop this exodus

Recruited by the NSA my orders to talk smooth and straight
 If heads of state try to say No I lovingly told them Fuck you
 The jackals lose when I cannot get through
 There is a windfall of profit to get to
 You better deal or were gonna take you down

And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
 The iron fist for blood and empire will make you move
 And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
 The iron fist for blood and empire will make you move
 So dance with me

Arbenz Mossadeq Allende Roldos Torrijos Aristide
 Elected democratically all snuffed out by the CIA
 The truth will cause your heart to seize
 Shed light on the true enemy

And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
 The iron fist for blood and empire will make you move
 And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
 The iron fist for blood and empire will make you move

What have we done You dont know
 Until you care You never will
 What have we done You dont know
 Until you care You never will

The crimes the murder unjust unheard of
 The crimes the murder what have we done

And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
 The iron fist for blood and empire will make you move
 And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
 The iron fist for blood and empire will make you move
 So dance with me












I always thought 
If you want to change the world 
Then you have to start with yourself 
So if the heads of state 
Want to end terrorism 
They should go ahead 
And kill themselves 

I will not sign my blind faith away 
To an unjustly leader 
Of the unjust police state 
Corporate masters live in their cess pool 
Of extreme wealth and excess 

The phrase world leaders 
Does not describe the heads of state 
Those few in power 
Work only 
For the corporate sake 
No action no interest 
No humanity at all 
As the corporate towers 
Rise up 
They watch the people fall 

A governement run 
By the corporations of the world 
Enslaving mothers fathers 
Sons and daughters 
Profits put before people 
Equal force equal reaction 
Equal suppression equal intimidations 
Equal propaganda equal rebellion 

Weve got to make a change 
No religions 
Sexual preference 
And regardless of your race 
Weve got to make a change 
No war corporate run 
Governements 
No police state 
Weve got to make a change 
For the good of the human race 
And you still look me in the eye 
And you still wonder why 
Your cities fucking burn 

No borders no nations 
No flags no patriots
You want to save the world 
I can tell you what to do 
You want to end terror 
This solution is for you 
Answer the call up join the proud the few 
Pull on the trigger with your heart and soul 
Cause war is peace now we know

Chorus
Fight fire with fire 
Douse violent flames with gasoline 
Fight fire with fire 
Spite your foe with an all out holocaust 
Fight fire with fire 
Pour gasoline on the world inferno 
Burn it so hot that the world incinerates 
When theyre all dead 
Well have no issues to resolve

To end terror it takes a special skill 
ill kill kill 
Till theres nothing left to kill 
Dont question orders 
Do your job and move 
Its a to and to 
To makes sure no ones left alive 

Chorus

Join now Dont wait 
Make death your date
Salute and fight 
Fight for the wealth of the few
Wrapped in a flag and sold to you
Sold as Freedom 
Its up to you to see through lies 
By those whove led us to endless world strife
What this world needs is something new 
What this world needs right now is you 
Any dumbfuck can murder kill kill kill
US Representative Jim McDermott
Depleted Uranium is used on the ends of bullets 
and on the ends of shells because it is so hard
Almost any armament is vulnerable to something that is tipped with Depleted Uranium

In the cities and towns of Afghanistan
In the heart of the Balkans the heart of Iraq
Not your Grandfathers style of deadly munitions
Its silent and deadly long after the mission

Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime

Gonna cut through their armor then cut through your lungs
If you make it home alive youll still die young
A greedy gang of liars yeah weve seen it all before
A moneymaking scheme led by warprofiteering whores

Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime

US Representative Jim McDermott
They were throwing it away until they figured out they could use it for armament

Half Life  Billion
Half Life Youll waste away
Half Life  Billion
Half Life Youll waste a

Weve heard their lies before and we know theyre lying again
Feels like a dcj vu of Agent Orange and Vietnam
Weaponry so sadistic it is hard to comprehend
War profits surge with every breath by Uncle Sam

Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime

US Representative Jim McDermott
We went to a hospital in Southern Iraq 
and a woman was there with a very deformed child and 
her husband had been in the Iraqi Army and had been 
in the battles in Southern Iraq and 
came home and they produced a baby with very severe 
malformations Both the Leukemia rates in children and 
malformations at birth had increased by % 
and it was clearly an epidemic where all this 
DU had been dumped It becomes a dust that can be 
inhaled and infect the blood stream and the rest 
of the body and it was the opinion of the 
doctors there that this was caused by depleted uranium
They simply saw this as being a direct result of the 
war by United States

Half Life  Billion
Half Life We waste away
Half Life  Billion
Half Life We waste away
Half Life  Billion
Half Life We waste away
Half Life  Billion
Half Life We waste away

US Representative Jim McDermott
The doctor said 
Women in Iraq at the time of birth dont ask if 
its a boy or a girl they ask Is it normal
The military denies first and then after the evidence
builds to the point where they can no longer deny 
then they do the research Thats what happened in the 
Vietnam era around Agent Orange and I suspect and 
Im worried that thats what will happen this time

I did my best to make it in the world 
I plowed by sweat in tears into the fertile 
Generation generation generated 
What was needed for supply to meet demand 

The sun shone bright on the ancient range 
Then the promise of the future 
Turned the NeoLiberal Plan 
The peoples voice shut up shut down abstain 
Is it gonna take a martyr to end the charade 

They tell you that youre out of luck 
While people fall 
They watch their profits rocket up 

Chorus
SOS this is a global call 
You better make a stand 
You better make it now 
Take back your rights from the IMF 
World Bank and Monsanto 
SOS this is a global call 
You better make a stand 
You better make it now 
Corporatocracy leads to profits for killers 
Profits for killers no 

Geneva to Washington Cancun to Seoul 
The Corporate Welfare State 
Running out of control 
The Corprocrats have got the guns 
But their numbers are few 
They can kill democracy 
But they cannot kill the truth 

So Step out on the matrix of the corporate slave 
So Step into the world of the living wage 
Not for one not for two not for three or four 
But for every single citizen around the fucking world 

The people in the fight of our lives 
The spark of revolution in a farmers suicide 

Chorus

When they wage war on you you lay asleep 
When they poison your food you choose to drink 
Theres poison in the well 

Yeah 

Stand Up Resist 
Monsanto are killers kkkkkillers 
Stand Up Resist 
Syngenta are killers kkkkkillers 
Stand Up Resist 
The World Bank are killers kkkkkillers Stand Up Resist 
Stand Up Resist 
The WTO are killers kkkkkillers
Stand Up Resist 
Oh no




Weve run out of patience
Youve run out of time
This scene will not fall victim
To your violence or lies

Your values are nothing
But excuses to start fights
Quit fronting like youre standing 
For a moral cause tonight

United as one we wont stand aside
You tried to fuck with our scene Were gonna fuck your life

This machine this machine this machine THIS MACHINE 
KILLS FUCKING FASCISTS
Dead Thats right DEAD

You dont have to be a racist 
To be a nazi fuck
Your mindless nationalism 
Gives you credentials enough

You spew your right wing rhetoric
When we got your attention
Youve mistaken the punk scene
For the Republican Convention

No more infiltration no more right wing lies
You dont belong in our scene Well fight you till we die

This machine this machine this machine THIS MACHINE 
KILLS FUCKING FASCISTS
Dead ahhh DIE
In a letter to every president congressman career politician
Scrawled in spite across the envelope
With all of our conviction
In only took a few hours for his peers
To find him guilty in a trial too fair
A wobblie immigrant worker has no place among the living

My body if I could choose to ashes it reduce

Murdered by the capitalist
 be careful of what you wish
Who is wrong and who is righteous

What was stolen from us we will replace
Off with the head on the body we feast
Who is wrong and who is righteous
Will never be our own decision

He yelled fire to the squad with guns they stopped his heart from beating
Every word he wrote he spoke he sung we are still singing

My body if I could choose to ashes it reduce
And let the breezes blow to where some flowers grow
Perhaps some fading flower then would come to life and bloom again

If the workers take a notion
They can stop all speeding trains
Every ship upon the ocean
They can tie with mighty chains
Every wheel in the creation
Every mine and every mill
Fleets and armies of all nations
Will at our command stand still








No justice in a legal system run by criminals
If you dont like the court ruling then you shouldnt be poor
Now go die 
Go die
Go die
One trillion dollars could buy a lot of bling
 One trillion dollars could buy most anything
 One trillion dollars buying bullets buying guns
 One trillion dollars in the hands of killers thugs

Woahohoh woahoh woahohohoh
 Fuck the world a lot of people gotta die tonight
 Woahohoh woahoh woahoh 
 Fuck the world 
 Kill em all

One trillion dollars to Africa Iraq
 One trillion dollars and its never coming back
 One trillion dollars could buy some badass drugs
 One trillion dollars makes me wanna kill myself

Woahohoh woahoh woahohohoh
 Fuck the world a lot of people gotta die tonight
 Woahohoh woahoh woahoh 
 Fuck the world yeah yeah
 Kill em all

Until the sun burns from the sky
 Until the sun burns so bright this world is no more
 Sun burns from the sky
 And all the people are just dust on the ground

One trillion dollars could buy a heart a soul
 One trillion dollars buying nations all the world
 One trillion dollars could make the fat lady sing
 One trillion dollars what a bullshit useless thing

Woahohoh woahoh woahohohoh
 Fuck the world a lot of people gotta die tonight
 Woahohoh woahoh woahohohoh
 Fuck the world a lot of people gotta die tonight
 Woahohoh woahoh woahohohoh
 Shit loads of money spent will show us wrong from right
 Fuck the world
 Kill em all


 year old girl in a hollow carved out place
 Just looking for some prettiness
 But the cuts in her arm dont paint for her a very pretty view
 In her mind she dreams that she is far away from

The bright lights of America
 Life and death in a sold outerica
 To live and die in the heart of America
 Where they sell souls
 The bright lights of America 
 Life and death in a sold outerica
 To live and die in the heart of America
 Where they sell souls

A concrete city hell city hell
 Suburbs that never end just like an ocean
 One parent lives in each of them
 Passed back and forth he huffs glue to escape both bitter homes
 Hes just one of desperate ranks who cant break free from

The bright lights of America
 Life and death in a sold outerica
 To live and die in the heart of America
 Where they sell souls
 The bright lights of America 
 life and death in a sold outerica
 To live and die in the heart of America
 Where they sell souls

I just want you to know there are warehouses full 
 Of fucked up kids like you and me cant find our way
 So many lost in strife caught in an endless fight
 To leave this empty ugly place Im leaving you as sane

The bright lights of America
 Life and death in a sold outerica
 To live and die in the heart of America
 Where they sell souls
 The bright lights of America 
 life and death in a sold outerica
 To live and die in the heart of America
 Where they sell souls

The bright lights of America
 Life and death in a sold outerica
 To live and die in the heart of America
 Where they sell souls
 The bright lights of America 
 life and death in a sold outerica
 To live and die in the heart of America
 Where they sell souls








Seems every station on the TV 
 is selling something no one can be 
 If every page was torn from the magazine 
 would cash still drive the media machine 
 The products damage and pursuit are endless 
 identity can leave you selfless 

We will not witness this anymore 
 This is the end for you my friend 
 I cant forgive I wont forget 
 on and on we sing our songs and 
 on and on the wars wage on and 
 on and on we sing our songs for more for more 

Your eyes are open but you cant see 
 your mouth is moving but you dont speak 
 a blitzkrieg of images to break your will 
 I hope you choke on every pill 

We will not witness this anymore 
 This is the end for you my friend 
 I cant forgive I wont forget 
 on and on we sing our songs and 
 on and on the wars wage on and 
 on and on we sing our songs for more 

We will not witness this anymore 
 This is the end for you my friend 
 I cant forgive I wont forget 

This is the end for you my friend 
 I cant forgive I wont forget

 On and on the wars wage on and 
 On and on we sing our songs and 
 On and on your wars wage on and 
 On and on we sing our songs for more 
 We sing our songs for more


Chorus
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Living the life

Close my eyes try to make it last
Outrun the wretched memories of my past

It moves too fast
I got no chance
A freight train racing set to crash

Chorus
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Living the life

Wake up wondering How did I get here
Then cross my heart and say a fucking prayer
Ecstasy tears bravery fears

This boat may float but it dont steer

Chorus
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Living the life

Lifes long and winding roads leading us
To a never ending trail to keep our youth

It flashes by in lessons painfully attained
Blood and sweat black and blue
Some surrender I got nothing to surrender to

Chorus
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Living the life

So now youre living

Chorus
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Living the life

Close my eyes try to make it last
Outrun the wretched memories of my past
This is the sound of a dropping bomb

After years are we still all content
With being pawns in war game chess
Shuffled by King George and his English Queen
On a board of autocracy

As fundamentalist citing stories and fables
Of whose god is more righteously skilled
In whose gods honor that we are all killed

A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead
A dead ringer for Armageddon yeah
Dead ringer dead
A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead
This State Funeral we do not mourn

And still the wicked sleep
And dream of endless years of tyranny
Passed on by incestuous means
Skull and Bone Freemason reigns

A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead
A dead ringer for Armageddon yeah
Dead ringer dead
A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead
This State Funeral we do not mourn

Destroy all adversary free yourself
Erase the common enemy free yourself
Extinguishing the quarry free yourself
Through the smoke screen we seek out justice



One billion workers stand up from their chairs
Their faces no longer struck with their fears
Attack Attack 
Stabbed in the back
Disgraced Disgraced
Traitors trade face to face
Revolution the engine of history

When all the lights go out
When all the world is in doubt
When all the goods cease to move
I wont be alone
When all the swords become plows
When all the fields are afoul
When all the cogs cease to turn
I wont be alone

Punching the clock stabbing the boss
We dont need the CEOs they need us
Attack Attack 
Outsourced for a hack
Disgraced Disgraced 
Displace and replace
Proletarians of the world unite
You have nothing to lose but your chains

When all the lights go out
When all the world is in doubt
When all the goods cease to move
I wont be alone
When all the swords become plows
When all the fields are afoul
When all the cogs cease to turn
I wont be alone

We are not numbers we are names
We wont be alone
We are not crime reports we are history
We wont be alone
No we are not folklore we are culture
We wont be alone
We are not human resources we are human beings
I wont be a I wont be a

When all the lights go out when all the lights go out

When all the lights go out

Who would Jesus bomb Yeah who would Jesus kill
The double talk is past surreal
The word of god is now the word of hate
War is peace and freedom is the police state
Cant you see the writing on the wall
Democracy lays trampled on the floor
You better believe that

Chorus
Hell yeah Im confused for sure what 
I thought was the New Millennium is 
Mr Orwell from the grave adding fresh ink to the page
As the unpresident declares an endless war
Welcome to 

Feels like Nazi Germany and Hitler on TV
As the unpresident spews his homophobic speech
Didnt the Allies fight a war to end extremist fascist law
So tell me NOW what the fuck are we fighting for

I just can not take it anymore
Democracy lays trampled on the floor
Man isnt freedom great

Chorus

Now weve got
Armies of peace armed to the teeth 
Delivering death to make the world a better place
So celebrate the weapons spending 
Say a toast to Armageddon raise some hell
Were all headed straight to hell

Chorus
Ive seen a lot of ripoffs in my life 
Seen a lot of scams 
A lot of crooks and crooked schemes crooked sharks 
Part one of the story reads
The liquor store thief 
The stick up man 
Thrown into the clink 
never coming back until the day hes grey and old 

I seen a lot of ripoffs in my life 
The ripoffs of the old and the young the weak the sick 
The never known 
Stabbed repeatedly in the back by the Wall Street suit 
The Washington hack 
Lining up their pockets with the peoples cash and
Laughing all the way to the bank 

Do you want to live your life as a slave 
In chains from the cradle to the grave 
The economy is suffering let it die

I seen a lot of bailouts in my life 
But where are the bailouts for the homeless and the poor 
And while were on the subject 
I could use a few bucks for a guitar amp 
A new six string and a tank of gas 
Everything that I want That I want

Were so fucked and we dont give a fuck no 
Were so fucked but no we just dont care no 
Were so fucked this world is shit out of luck 
and we dont give a fuck 

Do you want to live your life as a slave 
In chains from the cradle to the grave 
The economy is suffering let it die

When the cities burn down well all be warm 
When the cities burn down well all keep warm 
When the cities burn down well all be warm

Were so fucked were so fucked
Chorus
Sing a hymn for the dead 
Because in death as in life 
We are one in the same 
Sing a hymn for the world 
To avert eugenic errors go 

The sun sets the light fades 
The blood red on an empty street 
Its not night its not day 
Its no more for an unfortunate soul who 
Witnessed his life violently erased 
From the horror of the human race 
Bright futures exchanged for profit 
Living half alive 

Chorus

In life now pay respects to your blood 
Those in the vast of the great 
Unknown unite there your hearts one 
In moments youll never forget yeah 
History lessons direct from the grave 
Lost souls of the lost divide 
Liberate your generation 
Living rotting flesh 

Chorus

Call out tyranny 
A spark of dissent 
Can light a fury of flame 
Call out to be free 

Sound off Be the voice of a generation 
Dissent Youve got a choice to make 
Sound off Be the voice of a generation 
Dissent Youve got a choice to make 

Strip away Be the voice of a generation 
Strip away Youve got a choice to make 
Cut away Cut away 
Strip away Strip away 
Cut away Strip away your chains 

Chorus x
When all you need was a little motivation
They pointed fingers and yelled dead generation
When all you need was a little care
All you got was an old white hair blank stare
Have you ever needed an ounce of love
And all you got was a whole lot of fucked

Say your prayers
Its the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation

Condescending broad generalizations
Get real old real fast
Just because most hippies and their parents have sold out
Does not mean that you your children and their kids wont last

Say your prayers
Its the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation

Say your prayers
Its the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation

Aggressiveness is godliness
Combativeness is holiness
Destructiveness is faithfulness
Deadliness is devoutness
Praying to a god that they created
And know damn well does not exist
We find them on their knees



Like a ghost
Emptiness haunted his years
Still his heart was made of nothing less than good 
Insecure narrative in his head 
Something less than schizophrenia 
Creeping him with every move that he makes
 Breath he takes 
A pitiful walk alone 
To his empty home 
Where hell lay and hell sleep by himself

Go west young man
Your future is untold
You can find your dreams on the California coast 
Go west young man 
Your future 
isnt too far away
Go

She hates me 
And I know it because she said so
And I forgot my number 
And my socialist manifesto 
Will it be a tragedy 
Or a comedy
The choice is up to you 
Life can lead you along on a leash
Or you can break free 
And run on your own
Dont waste your life 
Go and live your life 
Like its your last day here on this earth

Go west young man
Your future is untold
You can find your dreams on the California coast 
Go west young man 
Your future isnt too 
Far away 
Far away

Dont waste your life
Go and live your life
Like its your last day here on this earth

Go west young man 
Your future is untold 
You can find your dreams on the California coast 
Go west young man
Your future isnt too
 Far away
Far away

Go west young man
Your future is untold 
You can find your dreams on the California coast 
Go west
We gotta work to make the facts fit the false charges
 Pull the wool over the eyes of the filthy masses
 Stab the people in the back for the corporate choice
 Roll the propaganda out using The Peoples Voice

We dont want to talk about it

The press scribble scribble every halftruth spoke
 Then shoot it round the country like an April Fools joke
 Hype the nation for a Desert Storm love affair
 Wave the stars and stripes like you just dont care

They talk it up all day they talk it up all night
 They talk until their face turns blue Red white and blue
 But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
 We find the picture still askew

They dont want to talk talk talk talk talk about it
 They wanna tiptoe walk around it
 Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
 They dont want to talk about it
 They wanna tiptoe walk around it
 Wave the flag and cowardly salute

And on the TV screen
 Diversion and aversion is the flavor of the day
 Was it WMDs Or Democracy
 Blame it on MI or the CIA
 The White House Press Corpse only has one thing to say

We dont want to talk about it

The White House boils over Al Jazeera got it wrong
 The Press Corpse jumps onboard singing the White House song
 While over in Iraq thousands are dead because of lies
 The spineless war drumming press corpse have taken lives

They talk it up all day they talk it up all night
 They talk until their face turns blue Red white and blue
 But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
 We find the picture still askew

They dont want to talk talk talk talk talk about it
 They wanna tiptoe walk around it
 Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
 They dont want to talk about it
 They wanna tiptoe walk around it
 Wave the flag and cowardly salute

Fires fueled on endless lies
 Black shrouds coat desert skies
 A nations viewpoint blurred and led
 As embeds report what theyre fed

We dont want to talk about it x

We dont want to talk about it 
 We dont dont want to we dont wanna talk about it
 We dont want to 
 We dont dont want to we dont wanna talk

They dont want to talk talk talk talk talk about it
 They wanna tiptoe walk around it
 Wave the flag and cowardly salute
 They dont want to talk about it
 They wanna tiptoe walk around it
 Wave the flag and cowardly salute






You can spoon my eyes out 
But I can still see through you 
Slice my ears from my head 
but you cant shut out the sounds of truth 
Lock off each hand at the wrist 
So I cant raise my fist 

You can kill the protester cant kill 
You cant kill the protest 
You can murder the rebel murder 
You cant murder the rebellion 

Sawed my feet at the ankles 
But I wasnt going to run I wasnt going to run 
So you grabbed my face 
And sliced off my tongue 
Lock off each hand at the wrist 
So I cant raise my fist 

You can kill the protester cant kill 
You cant kill the protest 
You can murder the rebel murder 
You cant murder the rebellion 

Lying still now no way to speak 
Theres nothing to fear theres nothing to fear 
Lying still now no way to speak 
Theres nothing to fear 
No nothing to fear 
Because bullets cant silence ideas 

You can kill the protester cant kill 
You cant kill the protest 
You can murder the rebel murder 
You cant murder the rebellion 

The rebellion 
The rebellion 
No 


Its a gut check of what you believe

LOOK BACK on history nothing much has changed
THOUSANDS of soldiers of all countries all marching the same
Every nations leader says that our side is right
Every nations leader says the time has come to fight
But they use the common people to settle their scores
ITS TIME THAT WE REFUSE TO FIGHT IN ANY OF THEIR WARS

Were looking to start a new army 
Too smart to fight too smart to die
Were looking to start a new army 
Too smart to fight too smart to kill 
For you
For you

One two three four one two three four
One two three four one two three four
One two three four one two three four
One two three four four

JOIN NOW the ranks of all nations who refuse to go to war
REFUSE to pull the trigger of a gun for leaders round the world
Id rather fight to spread some tolerance unity
Than buy into their nationalistic brainwashing
Killing mothers fathers sisters brothers common human beings
Not savages but people like you like me

Were looking to start a new army 
Too smart to fight too smart to die
Were looking to start a new army
Too smart to fight too smart to kill 

Were looking to start a new army
Too smart to fight too smart to die
Were looking to start a new army
Too smart to fight too smart to kill 
For you

Were looking for a few good men
Were looking for a few good women
Who are not afraid to fight against tyranny
But who refuse to fightwith tyrannytyranny
Refuse x

Were looking to start a new army 
Too smart to fight too smart to die

Too smart to fight too smart to kill

I woke up sweat soaked in the morning 
I was mourning freedom buried deep 
Mourning freedom buried deep 
In tickets and broadcasts through power lines 
Freedom buried in sound bites buried in headlines 

And we sing 
Woah oh Woah oh 

A nation in fervor has given up 
No no no this fight has just began 
With movements and revolutions as few and far between 
As movements and revolutions will ever come to be 

This scare is blood soaked red soaked red 
Marked down the last words that you said
As we watched this city 

Woah oh Woah oh 
Watch it burn 
Woah oh Woah oh 
Alright 

Its beaten in and beaten in 
Were coming back around again 
Its beaten in and beaten in 
Were coming back around again 

This scare is blood soaked red soaked red 
Marked down the last words that you said
As we watched this city

Fall and hit the ground 
No one can ever replace what weve lost now 
Fall and hit the ground 
No one can ever replace what weve lost now yeah 

Were coming back around 
Woah oh Woah oh

Down in some lone valley
In a sad lonesome place
Where the wild birds do all
Their notes to increase

Farewell pretty Saro
I bid you Adieu
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go

Well my love she wont have me
So I understand
She wants a freeholder
Who owns a house and land

I cannot maintain her
With silver and gold
And all of the fine things
That a big house can hold

If I was a poet
And could write a fine hand
Id write my love a letter
That shed understand

And write it by the river
Where the waters overflow
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go


    XVIII 
The man in me will do nearly any task
And as for compensation theres little he would ask
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me

Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I think to myself I might not take it any more
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me

But oh what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
Sets my a heart areeling
From my toes up to my ears

The man in me will hide sometimes
To keep from bein seen
But thats just because he doesnt want
To turn into some machine
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me
Oh the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathing
Like the stillness in the wind
Fore the hurricane begins
The hours when the ship comes in

And the seas will split
And the ship will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the wind will pound
And the morning will be breaking

Oh the fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls theyll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as theyre spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be atouching
And the ships wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watching

Oh the foes will rise
With the sleep in their eyes
And theyll jerk from their beds and think theyre dreaming
But theyll pinch themselves and squeal
And know that its for real
The hour that the ship comes in

Then theyll raise their hands
Saying Well meet all your demands
But well shout from the bow your days are numbered
And like Pharaohs tribe
Theyll be drownded in the tide
And like Goliath theyll be conquered
Shadows are falling and Ive been here all day
Its too hot to sleep time is running away
Feel like my soul has turned into steel
Ive still got the scars that the sun didnt heal
Theres not even room enough to be anywhere
Its not dark yet but its getting there

Well my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing theres been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing what was in her mind
I just dont see why I should even care
Its not dark yet but its getting there

Well Ive been to London and Ive been to gay Paree
Ive followed the river and I got to the sea
Ive been down on the bottom of a world full of lies
I aint looking for nothing in anyones eyes
Sometimes my burden seems more than I can bear
Its not dark yet but its getting there

I was born here and Ill die here against my will
I know it looks like Im moving but Im standing still
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb
I cant even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Dont even hear a murmur of a prayer
Its not dark yet but its getting there



Verse 
Oh where have you been my blueeyed son
Oh where have you been my darling young one
Ive stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
Ive walked and Ive crawled on six crooked highways
Ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
Ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And its a hard and its a hard its a hard and its a hard
And its a hard rains agoing to fall 

Verse 
Oh what did you see my blueeyed son
Oh what did you see my darling young one
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers ableeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And its a hard and its a hard its a hard its a hard
And its a hard rains agoing to fall 

Verse 
And what did you hear my blueeyed son
And what did you hear my darling young one
I heard the sound of a thunder it roared out a warning
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were ablazing
Heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening
Heard one person starve I heard many people laughing
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And its a hard and its a hard its a hard its a hard
And its a hard rains agoing to fall 

Verse 
Oh who did you meet my blueeyed son
Who did you meet my darling young one
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
And its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard
Its a hard rains agoing to fall 

Verse 
Oh what will you do now my blueeyed son
Oh what will you do now my darling young one
Im agoing back out fore the rain starts afalling
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioners face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color where none is the number
And Ill tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But Ill know my song well before I start singing
And its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard
Its a hard rains agoing to fall
I laid on a dune I looked at the sky
When the children were babies and played on the beach
You came up behind me I saw you go by
You were always so close and still within reach

Sara sara
Whatever made you want to change your mind 
Sara sara
So easy to look at so hard to define

I can still see them playin with their pails in the sand
They run to the water their buckets to fill
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
As they follow each other back up the hill

Sara sara
Sweet virgin angel sweet love of my life
Sara sara
Radiant jewel a mystical wife

Sleepin in the woods by a fire in the night
Drinkin white rum in a portugal bar
Them playin leapfrog and hearin about snow white
You in the marketplace in savannalamar

Sara sara
Its all so clear I could never forget
Sara sara
Lovin you is the one thing Ill never regret

I can still hear the sounds of those methodist bells
Id taken the cure and had just gotten through
Stayin up four days in the chelsea hotel
Writin sadeyed lady of the lowlands for you

Sara sara
Wherever we travel were never apart
Sara oh sara
Beautiful lady so dear to my heart

How did I meet you I dont know
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm
You were there in the winter moonlight on the snow
And on lily pond lane when the weather was warm

Sara oh sara
Scorpio sphinx in a calico dress
Sara sara
You must forgive me my unworthiness

Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore
You always responded when I needed your help
You gimme a map and a key to your door

Sara oh sara
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow
Sara oh sara
Dont ever leave me dont ever go
One by one they followed the sun
One by one until there were none
Two by two to their lovers they flew
Two by two into the foggy dew
Three by three they danced on the sea
Four by four they danced on the shore
Five by five they tried to survive
Six by six they were playing with tricks

How many paths did they try and fail
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail
How much poison did they inhale
How many black cats crossed their trail

Seven by seven they headed for heaven
Eight by eight they got to the gate
Nine by nine they drank the wine
Ten by ten they drank again

How many tomorrows have are they given away
How many compared to yesterday
How many more without any reward
How many more can they afford

Two by two they stepped into the ark
Two by two they step in the dark
Three by three theyre turning the key
Four by four they turn it some more
One by one they follow the sun
Two by two to another rendezvous
You go to my head 
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head 
Like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought 
That you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Cant you see that it never can be

You go to my head 
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though Im certain that this heart of mine
Hasnt a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

Its still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Well if youre travelin in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Well if you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if shes wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin winds

Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
Thats the way I remember her best

Im awonderin if she remembers me at all
Many times Ive often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

So if youre travelin in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin fallin down

You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they dont know how to smile

Your babys eyes look crazy
Theyre atuggin at your sleeve
Your babys eyes look crazy
Theyre atuggin at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If theres anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares

You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell yuh
That you aint agot no friend

Your babies are crying louder
Its pounding on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
Its pounding on your brain
Your wifes screams are stabbin you
Like the dirty drivin rain

Your grass it is turning black
Theres no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
Theres no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
Thats hangin on the wall

Your brain is ableedin
And your legs cant seem to stand
Your brain is ableedin
And your legs cant seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That youre holdin in your hand

Theres seven breezes ablowin
All around the cabin door
Theres seven breezes ablowin
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the oceans pounding roar

Theres seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Theres seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
Theres seven new people born
You walk into the room 
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say Who is that man
You try so hard
But you dont understand
Just what youll say
When you get home

Because something is happening here
But you dont know what it is
Do you Mister Jones

You raise up your head
And you ask Is this where it is
And somebody points to you and says
Its his
And you says Whats mine
And somebody else says Where what is
And you say Oh my God
Am I here all alone 

But something is happening here
But you dont know what it is
Do you Mister Jones

You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says How does it feel
To be such a freak
And you say Impossible
As he hands you a bone

And something is happening here
But you dont know what it is
Do you Mister Jones

You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To taxdeductible charity organizations
Youve been with the professors
And theyve all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
Youve been through all of
F Scott Fitzgeralds books
Youre very well read
Its well known

But something is happening here
And you dont know what it is
Do you Mister Jones

Well the sword swallower he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan

And you know something is happening
But you dont know what it is
Do you Mister Jones

Now you see this oneeyed midget
Shouting the word NOW
And you say For what reason
And he says How
And you say What does this mean
And he screams back Youre a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home

Because something is happening
But you dont know what it is
Do you Mister Jones

Well you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin around
You should be made
To wear earphones

Does something is happening
And you dont know what it is
Do you Mister Jones
Oh sister when I come to lie in your arms
You should not treat me like a stranger
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger

Oh sister am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection
And is our purpose not the same on this earth
To love and follow His direction

We grew up together 
From the cradle to the grave
We died and were reborn
And then mysteriously saved

Oh sister when I come to knock on your door
Dont turn away youll create sorrow
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow



Down the street the dogs are barkin
And the day is agettin dark
As the night comes in afallin
The dogsll lose their bark
An the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
For Im one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes they start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
An I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And Im one too many mornings
An a thousand miles behind

Its a restless hungry feeling
That dont mean no one no good
When evrything Im asayin
You can say it just as good
Youre right from your side
Im right from mine
Were both just one too many mornings
An a thousand miles behind
He was just a blueeyed Boston boy
His voice was low with pain
Ill do your bidding comrade mine
If I ride back again
But if you ride back and I am left
Youll do as much for me
Mother you know must hear the news
So write to her tenderly

Shes waiting at home like a patient saint
Her fond face pale with woe
Her heart will be broken when I am gone
Ill see her soon I know
Just then the order came to charge
For an instant hand touched hand
They said aye and away they rode
That brave and devoted band

Straight was the track to the top of the hill
The rebels they shot and shelled
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And guarded them as they fell
There soon came a horrible dying yell
From heights that they could not gain
And those whom doom and death had spared
Rode slowly back again

But among the dead that were left on the hill
Was the boy with the curly hair
The tall dark man who rode by his side
Lay dead beside him there
Theres no one to write to the blueeyed girl
The words that her lover had said
Momma you know awaits the news
And shell only know hes dead
Sleigh bells ring are you listening 
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
Were happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

Hell say Are you married
Well say No man 
But you can do the job
When youre in town

Later on well conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid 
The plans that weve made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that hes a circus clown
Well have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows aint it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
Well frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

There must be some way out of here said the Joker to the Thief
 Theres too much confusion I cant get no relief
 Businessmen they drink my wine plowmen dig my earth
 None of them along the line know what any of it is worth

No reason to get excited the thief he kindly spoke
 There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
 But you and I weve been through that and this is not our fate
 So let us not talk falsely now the hour is getting late

All along the watchtower princess kept the view
 While all the women came and went barefoot servants too
 Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
 Two riders were approaching the wind began to howl















All Along the Watchtower

There must be some way out of here said the joker to the thief

There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I weve been through that and this is not our fate

A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers blood
A finger fired the trigger to his name
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a mans brain
But he cant be blamed
Hes only a pawn in their game

A South politician preaches to the poor white man
 You got more than blacks dont complain
Youre better than them you been born with white skin they explain
And the Negros name
Is used it is plain
For the politicians gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it aint him to blame
Hes only a pawn in their game

The deputy sheriffs the soldiers the governors get paid
And the marshals and cops get the same
But the poor white mans used in the hands of them all like a tool
Hes taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
Bout the shape that hes in
But it aint him to blame
Hes only a pawn in their game

From the poverty shacks he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the hoof beats pound in his brain
And hes taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back
With his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He aint got no name
But it aint him to blame
Hes only a pawn in their game

Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
They lowered him down as a king
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun
Hell see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain
Only a pawn in their game




Im out here a thousand miles from my home
Walking a road other men have gone down
Im seeing a new world of people and things
Hear paupers and peasants and princes and kings

Hey hey Woody Guthrie I wrote you a song
About a funny old world thats coming along
Seems sick and its hungry its tired and its torn
It looks like its dying and its hardly been born

Hey Woody Guthrie but I know that you know
All the things that Im saying and a many times more
Im singing you the song but I cant you sing enough
Cause theres not many men thatve done the things that youve done

Heres to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too
And to all the good people that travelled with you
Heres to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind

Im leaving tomorrow but I could leave today
Somewhere down the road someday
The very last thing that Id want to do
Is to say Ive been hitting some hard travelling too




Oh Im sailing away my own true love
Im sailing away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
From the place that Ill be landing

No theres nothing you can send me my own true love
Theres nothing I wish to be owning
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Oh but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

Oh but if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
Id forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For thats all Im wishing to be owning

That I might be gone a long time
And its only that Im asking
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passing

Oh how can how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I want from you today
I would want again tomorrow

I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship asailing
Saying I dont know when Ill be coming back again
It depends on how Im afeeling

Well if you my love must think thataway
Im sure your mind is roaming
Im sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where youre going

So take heed take heed of the western wind
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes theres something you can send back to me 
Spanish boots of Spanish leather
Oxford Town Oxford Town
Evrybodys got their hats bowed down
The sun dont shine above the ground
Aint agoing down to Oxford Town

He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town

Oxford Town around the bend
He comes to the door he coulnt get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that my frien 

Me and my gal my gals son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
I dont even know why we come
Going back where we come from

Oxford Town in the afternoon
Evrybody singing a sorrowful tune
Two men died neath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon
I love you more than ever more than time and more than love
I love you more than money and more than the stars above
Love you more than madness more than waves upon the sea
Love you more than life itself you mean that much to me

Ever since you walked right in the circles been complete
Ive said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun
I love you more than ever and I havent yet begun

You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole
Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul

You gave me babies one two three what is more you saved my life
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth your love cuts like a knife
My thoughts of you dont ever rest theyd kill me if I lie
Id sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die

The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth
Well play it out the best we know whatever it is worth
Whats lost is lost we cant regain what went down in the flood
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood

Its never been my duty to remake the world at large
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge
Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesnt bend
And if there is eternity Id love you there again

Oh cant you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you you were born to be my bride
Youre the other half of what I am youre the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesnt cease

You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see
Just bein next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go no matter what goes on
cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone
Pistols shots ring out in the barroom night
 Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
 She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
 Cries out My God they killed them all
 Here comes the story of the Hurricane
 The man the authorities came to blame
 For something that he never done
 Put him in a prison cell but one time he coulda been
 The champion of the world

Three bodies lying there does Patty see
 And another man named Bello moving around mysteriously
 I didnt do it he says and he throws up his hands
 I was only robbing the register I hope you understand
 I saw them leaving he says and he stops
 One of us had better call up the cops
 And so Patty calls the cops
 And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing
 In the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile far away in another part of town
 Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
 Number one contender for the middleweight crown
 Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
 When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
 Just like the time before and the time before that
 In Patterson thats just the way things go
 If youre black you might as well not SHOW up on the street
 Less you wanna draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the corps
 Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
 He said I saw two men running out 
 They looked like middleweights
 They jumped into a white car with outofstate plates
 And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
 Cop said Wait a minute boys this ones not dead
 So they took him to the infirmary
 And though this man could hardly see
 They told him that he could identify the guilty men

Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
 Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
 The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
 Says Whad you bring him in here for He aint the guy 
 Yes here comes the story of the Hurricane
 The man the authorities came to blame
 For something that he never done
 Put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been
 The champion of the world

Four months later the ghettos are in flame
 Rubins in South America fighting for his name
 While Arthur Dexter Bradleys still in the robbery game
 And the cops are putting the screws to him 
 Looking for somebody to blame
 Remember that murder that happened in a bar 
 Remember you said you saw the getaway car
 You think youd like to play ball with the law 
 Think it mighta been that fighter you saw running that night 
 Dont forget that you are white

Arthur Dexter Bradley said Im really not sure
 Cops said A boy like you 
 Could use a break
 We got you for the motel job 
 And were talking to your friend Bello
 Now you dont wanta have to go back to jail 
 Be a nice fellow
 Youll be doing society a favor
 That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver
 We want to put his ass in stir
 We want to pin this triple murder on him
 He aint no Gentleman Jim

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
 But he never did like to talk about it all that much
 Its my work hed say and I do it for pay
 And when its over Id just as soon go on my way
 Up to some paradise
 Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
 And ride a horse along a trail
 But then they took him to the jailhouse
 Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

All of Rubins cards were marked in advance
 The trial was a pigcircus he never had a chance
 The judge made Rubins witnesses 
 Drunkards from the slums
 To the white folks who watched 
 He was a revolutionary bum
 And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
 No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
 And though they could not produce the gun
 The DA said he was the one who did the deed
 And the allwhite jury agreed

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
 The crime was murder one guess who testified
 Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
 And the newspapers they all went along for the ride
 How can the life of such a man
 Be in the palm of some fools hand 
 To see him obviously framed
 Couldnt help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land 
 Where justice is a game

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
 Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
 While Rubin sits like Buddha in a tenfoot cell
 An innocent man in a living hell
 Thats the story of the Hurricane
 But it wont be over till they clear his name
 And give him back the time hes done
 Put him in a prison cell but one time he coulda been
 The champion of the world







A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
Theres a woman on my lap and shes drinking champagne
Got white skin got assassins eyes
Im looking up into the sapphiretinted skies
Im well dressed waiting on the last train

Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now Im expecting all hell to break loose

Chorus
People are crazy and times are strange
Im locked in tight Im out of range
I used to care but things have changed

This place aint doing me any good
Im in the wrong town I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag
Aint no shortcuts gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think hes got anything to prove

Lot of water under the bridge lot of other stuff too
Dont get up gentlemen Im only passing through

Chorus
People are crazy and times are strange
Im locked in tight Im out of range
I used to care but things have changed

Ive been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right the world will explode
Ive been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You cant win with a losing hand

Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street

Chorus
People are crazy and times are strange
Im locked in tight Im out of range
I used to care but things have changed

I hurt easy I just dont show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get low down gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
Im in love with a woman who dont even appeal to me

Mr Jinx and Miss Lucy they jumped in the lake
Im not that eager to make a mistake

Chorus
People are crazy and times are strange
Im locked in tight Im out of range
I used to care but things have changed

Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
It makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do what to do

Have you ever felt a gentle touch
And then a kiss and then and then
Find its only your imagination again

Imagination is silly
You go around willy nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I cant imagine that you want me too

Oh my name it is nothing
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
Is taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And the land that I live in
Has God on its side

Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Oh the country was young
With God on its side

The SpanishAmerican
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
Is made to memorize
With guns on their hands
And God on their side

The First World War boys
It came and it went
The reason for fighting
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you dont count the dead
When Gods on your side

When the Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side

Ive learned to hate Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
Its them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side

But now we got weapons
Of the chemical dust
If fire them were forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When Gods on your side

In a many dark hour
Ive been thinking about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I cant think for you
Youll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side

So now as Im leaving
Im weary as hell
The confusion Im feeling
Aint no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And fall to the floor
If Gods on our side
Hell stop the next war
Come gather round friends
And Ill tell you a tale
Of when the red iron pits ran empty
But the cardboard filled windows
And old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty

In the north end of town
My own children are grown
But I was raised on the other
In the wee hours of youth
My mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother

The iron ore poured
As the years passed the door
The drag lines an the shovels they was ahumming
Til one day my brother
Failed to come home
The same as my father before him

Well a long winters wait
From the window I watched
My friends they couldnt have been kinder
And my schooling was cut
As I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas a miner

Oh the years passed again
And the giving was good
With the lunch bucket filled every season
What with three babies born
The work was cut down
To a half a days shift with no reason
Then the shaft was soon shut
And more work was cut
And the fire in the air it felt frozen
Til a man come to speak
And he said in one week
That number eleven was closing

They complained in the East
They are playing too high
They say that your ore aint worth digging
That its much cheaper down
In the South American towns
Where the miners work almost for nothing

So the mining gates locked
And the red iron rotted
And the room smelted heavy from drinking
Where the sad silent song
Made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking

I lived by the window
As he talked to himself
This silence of tongues it was building
Then one mornings wake
The bed it was bare
And Is left alone with three children

The summer is gone
The grounds turning cold
The stores one by one theyre afolding
My children will go
As soon they grow
Well there aint nothing here now to hold them
I pity the poor immigrant 
Who wishes he wouldve stayed home
Who uses all his power to do evil
But in the end is always left so alone
That man who with his fingers cheats
And who lies with every breath
Who passionately hates his life
And likewise fears his death

I pity the poor immigrant
Whos strength is spend in vain
Whos heaven is like ironsides
Whos tears are like rain
Who eats but is not satisfied
Who hears but does not see
Who falls in love with wealth itself
And turns his back on me

I pity the poor immigrant
Who tramples through the mud
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood
Whos visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass
I pity the poor immigrant
When his gladness comes to pass
William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gathrin
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for firstdegree murder
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now aint the time for your tears

William Zanzinger who at twentyfour years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering and his tongue it was snarling
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now aint the time for your tears

Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen
She was fiftyone years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didnt even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now aint the time for your tears

In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
To show that alls equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books aint pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught em
And that ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feeling that way witout warning
And he spoke through his cloak most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a sixmonth sentence
Oh but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Bury the rag deep in your face
For nows the time for your tears



                                         
Some time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt I was walkin into World War Three
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kinda words he could say
He said It was a bad dream
I wouldnt worry bout it none though
Theyre dreams and theyre only in your head

I said Hold it Doc a World War passed through my brain
He said Nurse get your pad this boys insane
He grabbed my arm I said Ouch
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said Tell me about it

Well the whole thing started at oclock fast
It was all over by quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on

Well I got up and walked around
And up and down the lonesome town
I stood awondering which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
And walked on down the road
It was a normal day

Well I rung the fallout shelter bell
And leaned my head and I gave a yell
Give me a string bean Im a hungry man
A shotgun fired and away I ran
I dont blame them too much though
They didnt know me

Down at the corner by a hotdog stand
I seen a man I said Howdy friend
I guess theres just us two
He screamed a bit and away he flew
Thought I was a Communist

Well I spied me a girl and before she could leave
Lets go and play Adam and Eve
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin
When she said Hey man you crazy or sumthin
You see what happened last time they started
Well I seen a Cadillac window uptown
And there was nobody aroun
I got into the drivers seat
And I drove down to nd Street
In my Cadillac
Good car to drive after a war

Well I remember seein some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didnt pay my Con Ed bill
So the radio didnt work so well
Turned on my record player
It was RockADay Johnny singin
Tell Your Ma Tell Your Pa
Our Loves Are Gonna Grow Oohwah Oohwah
 
I was feelin kinda lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
When you hear the beep
It will be three oclock
She said that for over an hour
And I hung up

Well the doctor interrupted me just about then
Sayin Hey Ive been havin the same old dreams
But mine was a little different you see
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me
I didnt see you around

Well now time passed and now it seems
Everybodys having them dreams
Everybody sees themselves walkin around with no one else
Half of the people can be part right all of the time
Some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people cant be all right all of the time
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
Ill let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours
 I said that
Johnnys in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
Im on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out laid off
Says hes got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
Its something you did
God knows when
But youre doin it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap
In the pig pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten

Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phones tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early may
Orders from the DA 
Look out kid
Dont matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Dont try No Doz
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You dont need a weatherman
To know which way the wind blows 	

Get sick get well
Hang around an ink well
Ring bell hard to tell
If anything is goin to sell
Try hard get barred
Get back write Braille
Get jailed jump bail
Join the army if you fail
Look out kid 
Youre gonna get hit
By losers cheaters
Sixtime users
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin for a new fool
Dont follow leaders 
Watch the parkin meters

Ah get born keep warm
Short pants romance learn to dance
Get dressed get blessed
Try to be a success 
Please her please him buy gifts
Dont steal dont lift
Twenty years of schoolin
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid 
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole 
Light yourself a candle
Dont wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Dont wanna be a bum
You better chew gum 
The pump dont work
Cause the vandals took the handles
How much do I love you
Ill tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean
How high is the sky

How many times a day do I think of you
How many roses are sprinkled with dew

How far would I travel
To be where you are
How far is the journey
From here to a star

And if I ever lost you 
How much would I cry
How deep is the ocean
How high is the sky

How far would I travel
To be where you are
How far is the journey
From here to a star

And if I ever lost you 
How much would I cry
How deep is the ocean
How high is the sky
How high is the sky
Well Im grinding my life out steady and sure
Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
Im drenched in the light that shines from the sun
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
Sooner or later you make a mistake
Ill put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood but not my own

Night after night day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb
Im circling around the Southern Zone
I pay in blood but not my own

Low cards are what Ive got
But Ill play this hand whether I like it or not
Im sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad
Ive been out and around with the rowdy men
Just like you my handsome friend
My heads so hard must be made of stone
I pay in blood but not my own

Another politician pumping out the piss
Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
You got the same eyes that your mother does
If only you could prove who your father was
Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine
You gulped it down and you cross the line
Man cant live by bread alone
I pay in blood but not my own

How I made it back home nobody knows
Or how I survived so many blows
Ive been through hell what good did it do
You bastard Im suppose to respect you
Ill give you justice Ill fatten your purse
Show me your moral virtues first
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own

You pet your lover in the bed
Come here Ill break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
Youve been accused of murder how do you plead
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury not to praise
Ill drink my fill and sleep alone
I pay in blood but not my own
Damn you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like its your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young peoples blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

Youve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You aint worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that Im young
You might say Im unlearned
But theres one thing I know
Though Im younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your deathll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And Ill watch while youre lowered
Down to your deathbed
And Ill stand over your grave
Til Im sure that youre dead
Come gather round people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon youll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin
Then you better start swimmin or youll sink like a stone
For the times they are achangin

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide the chance wont come again
And dont speak too soon for the wheels still in spin
And theres no tellin who that its namin
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are achangin

Come senators congressmen please heed the call
Dont stand in the doorway dont block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Theres a battle outside and it is ragin
Itll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are achangin

Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And dont criticize what you cant understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin
Please get out of the new one if you cant lend your hand
For the times they are achangin

The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are achangin


The Times They Are AChanging

Come gather round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown

And accept it that soon
Youll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you
Is worth savin

Then you better start swimmin
Or youlll sink like a stone
For the times they are achangin

Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance wont come again

And dont speak too soon
For the wheel still in spin
And theres no telling who
That its namin

For the loser now
Will be later the win
For the times they are achanging

Come senators congressmen 
Please heed the call
Dont stand in the doorway
Dont block up the hall

For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
The battle outside
Ragging 

Will soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are achangin

Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And dont criticize
What you cant understand

Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly agin

Please get out of the new one
If you cant lend your hand
For the times they are achanging

The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one
Will later be fast

And the present now
Will soon be the past
The order is
Rapidly fadin

And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are achanging


You must leave now take what you need you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin through
And its all over now baby blue

The highway is for gamblers better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The emptyhanded painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky too is folding under you
And its all over now baby blue

All your seasick sailors they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies are all going home
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is moving under you
And its all over now baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind something calls for you
Forget the dead youve left they will not follow you
The vagabond whos rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match go start anew
And its all over now baby blue





What good am I if Im like all the rest
If I just turn away when I see how youre dressed
If I shut myself off so I cant hear you cry
What good am I

What good am I if I know and dont do
If I see and dont say if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin sky
What good am I

What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who dont try
What good am I

What good am I then to others and me
If Ive had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been

What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
What good am I
You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side thats winning

You say I let you down
You know its not like that
If youre so hurt
Why then dont you show it

You say you lost your faith
But thats not where its at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
Youre in with

Do you take me for such a fool
To think Id make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he dont know to begin with

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say How are you Good luck
But you dont mean it

When you know as well as me
Youd rather see me paralyzed
Why dont you just come out once
And scream it

No I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps Id rob them

And now I know youre dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Dont you understand
Its not my problem

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

Yes I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
Youd know what a drag it is
To see you
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed 
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed 
Whatever colors you have in your mind 
Ill show them to you and youll see them shine 

Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed 
Stay lady stay stay with your man awhile 
Until the break of day let me see 
You make him smile 
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean 
And youre the best thing that hes ever seen 

Stay lady stay stay with your man awhile 
Why wait any longer for the world to begin 
You can have your cake and eat it too 
Why wait any longer for the one you love 
When hes standing in front of you 

Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed 
Stay lady stay stay while the night is still ahead 
I long to see you in the morning light 
I long to reach for you in the night



If you see her say hello she might be in Tangier 
She left here last early spring is livin there I hear 
Say for me that Im all right though things get kind of slow 
She might think that Ive forgotten her dont tell her it isnt so 

We had a fallingout like lovers often will 
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill 
And though our separation it pierced me to the heart 
She still lives inside of me weve never been apart 

If you get close to her kiss her once for me 
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin free 
Oh whatever makes her happy I wont stand in the way 
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay 

I see a lot of people as I make the rounds 
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town 
And Ive never gotten used to it Ive just learned to turn it off 
Either Im too sensitive or else Im gettin soft 

Sundown yellow moon I replay the past 
I know every scene by heart they all went by so fast 
If shes passin back this way Im not that hard to find 
Tell her she can look me up if shes got the time

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime didnt you
Peopled call say Beware doll youre bound to fall
You thought they were all kiddin you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin out
Now you dont talk so loud
Now you dont seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

Youve gone to the finest school all right Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out youre gonna have to get used to it
You said youd never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
Hes not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him do you want to make a deal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it aint no good
You shouldnt let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Aint it hard when you discover that
He really wasnt where its at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
Theyre drinkin thinkin that they got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
But youd better lift your diamond ring youd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now he calls you you cant refuse
When you got nothing you got nothing to lose
Youre invisible now you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone


Go way from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
Im not the one you want babe
Im not the one you need
You say youre lookin for someone
Whos never weak but always strong
To protect you an defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it aint me babe
No no no it aint me babe 
It aint me youre lookin for babe

Go lightly from the ledge babe
Go lightly on the ground
Im not the one you want babe
I will only let your down
You say youre lookin for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you an more
But it aint me babe
No no no it aint me babe
It aint me youre lookin for babe

Go melt back into the night
Everything inside is made of stone
Theres nothing in here moving
An anyway Im not alone
You say youre looking for someone
Wholl pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
An to come each time you call
A lover for you life an nothing more
But it aint me babe
No no no it aint me babe
It aint me youre lookin for babe
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning long time ago

He saw an animal that liked to growl
Big furry paws and he liked to howl
Great big furry back and furry hair
Ah think Ill call it a bear

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning long time ago

He saw an animal up on a hill
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled
He saw milk coming out but he didnt know how
Ah think Ill call it a cow

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning long time ago

He saw an animal that liked to snort
Horns on his head and they werent too short
It looked like there wasnt nothing that he couldnt pull
Ah Ill think Ill call it a bull

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning long time ago

He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail
Real dirty face and a curly trail
He wasnt too small and he wasnt too big
Ah think Ill call it a pig

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning long time ago

Next animal that he did meet
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
Ah think Ill call it a sheep

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning long time ago

He saw an animal as smooth as glass
Slithering his way through the grass
Saw him dissappear by a tree near a lake
Theyre
 Selling postcards
 Of the hanging
 Theyre painting
 The passports brown
 The beauty parlor
 Is filled with sailors
 The circus is in town
 Here comes
 The blind commissioner
 Theyve got him in a trance
 One hand is tied
 To the tightrope walker
 The other is in his pants
 And the riot squad
 Theyre restless
 They need somewhere to go
 As Lady
 And I look out tonight
 From Desolation Row

Cinderella
 She seems so easy
 It takes one to know one
 She smiles
 And puts her hands
 In her back pockets
 Bette Davis style
 And in comes Romeo
 Hes moaning
 You belong to me I believe
 And someone says
 Youre in the wrong place
 My friend
 You better leave
 And the only sound thats left
 After the ambulances go
 Is Cinderella sweeping up
 On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
 The stars are beginning to hide
 The fortunetelling lady
 Has even taken
 All her things inside
 All except for Cain and Abel
 And the hunchback of Notre Dame
 Everybody is making love
 Or else expecting rain
 And the Good Samaritan
 Hes dressing
 Hes getting ready
 For the show
 Hes going
 To the carnival tonight
 On Desolation Row

Now Ophelia
 Shes neath the window
 For her I feel so afraid
 On her twentysecond birthday
 She already is an old maid

To her death
 Is quite romantic
 She wears an iron vest
 Her professions her religion
 Her sin is her lifelessness
 And though her eyes
 Are fixed upon
 Noahs great rainbow
 She spends her time peeking
 Into Desolation Row

Einstein
 Disguised as Robin Hood
 With his memories in a trunk
 Passed this way an hour ago
 With his friend
 A jealous monk
 He looked
 So immaculately frightful
 As he bummed a cigarette
 Then he went off
 Sniffing drainpipes
 And reciting the alphabet
 Now you
 Would not think
 To look at him
 But he was famous long ago
 For playing
 The electric violin
 On Desolation Row

Dr Filth he keeps his world
 Inside of a leather cup
 But all his sexless patients
 Theyre trying to blow it up
 Now his nurse some local loser
 Shes in charge
 Of the cyanide hole
 And she also keeps
 The cards that read
 Have Mercy on His Soul
 They all play
 On penny whistles
 You can hear them blow
 If you lean
 Your head out far enough
 From Desolation Row

Across the street
 Theyve nailed the curtains
 Theyre getting ready
 For the feast
 The Phantom of the Opera
 A perfect image of a priest
 Theyre spoonfeeding Casanova
 To get him to feel more assured
 Then theyll kill him
 With selfconfidence
 After poisoning him with words

And the Phantoms
 Shouting to skinny girls
 Get outa here
 If you dont know
 Casanova is just being
 Punished for going
 To Desolation Row

Now at midnight all the agents
 And the superhuman crew
 Come out and round up everyone
 That knows more than they do
 Then they bring them to the factory
 Where the heartattack machine
 Is strapped across their shoulders
 And then the kerosene
 Is brought down from the castles
 By insurance men who go
 Check to see
 That nobody is escaping
 To Desolation Row

Praise be to Neros Neptune
 The Titanic sails at dawn
 And everybodys shouting
 Which Side Are You On
 And Ezra Pound and T S Eliot
 Fighting in the captains tower
 While calypso singers laugh at them
 And fishermen hold flowers
 Between the windows of the sea
 Where lovely mermaids flow
 And nobody has to think too much
 About Desolation Row

Yes
 I received your letter yesterday
 About the time the door knob broke
 When you asked how I was doing
 Was that some kind of joke
 All these people that you mention
 Yes I know them theyre quite lame
 I had to rearrange their faces
 And give them all another name
 Right now I cant read too good
 Dont send me no more letters no
 Not unless you mail them
 From Desolation Row


   Desolation Row   My Chemical Romance









When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you havent made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
Ive known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

Id go hungry Id go black and blue
Id go crawling down the avenue
No theres nothing that I wouldnt do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change are blowing wild and free
You aint seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldnt do 
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love

To make you feel my love



Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
Dust on my face and my cape
Me and Magdalena on the run
I think this time we shall escape

Sold my guitar to the bakers son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide
But I can get another one
And Ill play for Magdalena as we ride

No llores mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon

Was it me that shot him down in the cantina
Was it my hand that held the gun
Come let us fly my Magdalena
The dogs are barking and whats done is done

No llores mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

At the corrida well sit in the shade
And watch the young torero stand alone
Well drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When they rode with Villa into Torreon

Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the little church this side of town
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
Youll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown

The way is long but the end is near
Already the fiesta has begun
The face of God will appear
With His serpent eyes of obsidian

No llores mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

Was that the thunder that I heard
My head is vibrating I feel a sharp pain
Come sit by me dont say a word
Oh can it be that I am slain

Quick Magdalena take my gun
Look up in the hills that flash of light
Aim well my little one
We may not make it through the night

No llores mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still

Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
Then I knew the spark of love was still burning
Therell be no new romance for me its foolish to start
Cause that old feeling is still in my heart

Therell be no new romance for me its foolish to start
Cause that old feeling is still in my heart
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the risin sun
And its been the ruin of many a poor girl and me
Oh god Im one

My mother was a tailor
She sowed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler lord
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time hes satisfied
Is when hes on a drunk

He fills his glasses up to the brim
And hell pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is ramblin from town to town

Oh tell my baby sister
Not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans
They call the rising sun

Well now one foot on the platform
And the other foot on the train
Im goin back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Im goin back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
Im goin back to end my life
Down in the risin sun

Well there is a house in New Orleans
They call the risin sun
Its been the ruin of many poor girl and me
And god I know Im one



  
Crickets are chirpin the water is high
Theres a soft cotton dress on the line hangin dry
The windows wide open African trees
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
Not a word of goodbye not even a note
Shed gone with the man in the long black coat

Somebody seen him hangin around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance he had a face like a mask
Somebody said from the Bible hed quote
There was dust on the man in the long black coat

Preacher was atalkin theres a sermon he gave
He said Every mans conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When its you who must keep it satisfied
It aint easy to swallow it sticks in the throat
She gave her heart to the man in the long black coat

There are no mistakes in life some people say
And its true sometimes you can see it that way
But people dont live or die people just float
She went with the man in the long black coat

Theres smoke on the water its been there since June
Tree trunks uprooted beneath the high crescent moon
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumblin force
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse 

She never said nothin there was nothin she wrote
Shed gone with the man in the long black coat






There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over its face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day
I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadnt the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day

Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer was he than I
The moon went down stars were gone
But the sun didnt rise with the dawn
There wasnt a thing left to say
The night we called it a day
There wasnt a thing left to say
The night we called it a day


    Frank Sinatra
Dont want to have you hanging
Around me like a leech
I think your just a problem
So stay the hell away from me
Because I dont believe in you

And I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Dont want to fall in love

Dont need security
I aint no dog without a bone
Dont have no time for love
So stay the fuck away from me
Because I dont believe in you

And I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Dont want to fall in love

And I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Dont want to fall in love

This may sound a little rough
Dont want to fall in love
This may sound a little rough
Dont want to fall in love
This may sound a little fucked
Dont want to fall in love


Standing on the corner of
Stuart and the Avenue
Ripping up my transfer
And a photograph of you
Youre a blur of my dead past 
And rotting existance
As I stand laughing 
On the corner of insignificance

Well destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now its all fucked up

Seasons change as well as minds
And Im a two faced clown
Youre mommys little nightmare
Driving daddys car around
Im beat down and half brain dead
The long lost king of fools
I may be dumb
But Im not stupid enough to stay with you

Well destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now its all fucked up
x

Were all fucked up
Youre all fucked up
I lost my way oh baby 
This stray heart
Went to another
Can you recover baby

Oh youre the only one that
Im dreaming of
Your precious heart 
Was torn apart by me

And you youre not alone
Oh and Im where I belong
Were not alone oh Ill hold your
Heart and never let go

Everything that I want I want from you
But I just cant have you
Everything that I need I need from you
But I just cant have you

I said a thousand times 
And now a thousand one
Well never part 
Ill never stray again from you

This dog is desperate for a 
Home to your heart
Well never part 
Ill never stray again from you

Youre not alone
Oh and Im where I belong
Were not alone oh Ill hold your 
Heart and never let go

Everything that I want I want from you
But I just cant have you
Everything that I need I need from you
But I just cant have you

Youre not alone
Oh and Im where I belong
Were not alone oh Ill hold your 
Heart and never let go

Everything I want I want from you
But I just cant have you
Everything I need I need from you
But I just cant have you

Everything I want I want from you
But I just cant have you
Everything I need I need from you
But I just cant have you

 Is making room for the one and only

King for a day princess by dawn
 King for a day in a leather thong
 King for a day princess by dawn
 Just wait til all the guys get a load of me

My daddy threw me in therapy
 He thinks Im not a real man
 Who put the drag in the drag queen
 Dont knock it until you tried it 


She she is my wild one
My heart is in a panic
Her eyes look so manic now

She little wild one
My heart is a chaser
Shes strung out on razors now

She gave up on Jesus
For living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
Im drinking the Kool aid
I jumped on the grenade
Now that my minds gonna blow

Hello

She shes my wild one
My heart is in danger
From shadows and strangers now

She little wild one
Shes covered in angels
And demons and halos now

She gave up on Jesus
For living on venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
Im drinking the Kool aid
I jumped on the grenade
Now that my minds gonna blow

Hello

She gave up on Jesus
For living on venus
All fucked up with nowhere to go
Im drinking the Kool aid
I jumped on the grenade
Now that my minds gonna blow

Hello

Little wild one
My heart is in danger
Shes strung out on razors now

My heart is in danger
Shes strung out on razors now



Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
wake me up when September ends

Like my fathers come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
Ill never do exactly what I want
And Ill sculpt my life for your acceptance

I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
Ill never do exactly what I want
And Ill sculpt my life for your acceptance

And I feel forgotten
Feel like rotting
Do you feel the same
Do you feel the same
Adolescence
Just cant make sense
Its calling my name
Its calling my name

I take a look around
And all the things Ive found
I call it blind hatred
If youd stop a while
And maybe if youd smile
You would realize that
Were all the same

Its just like our brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain

All my life Ive seemed to have this need
I think at times it even turns to greed
We all want to join some family
Well even sacrifice a moral changing

And I feel forgotten
Feel like rotting
Do you feel the same
Do you feel the same
Adolescence
Just cant make sense
Its calling my name
Its calling my name

I take a look around
And all the things Ive found
I call it blind hatred
If youd stop a while
And maybe if youd smile
You would realize that
Were all the same

Its just like our brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain

I take a look around
And all the things Ive found
I call it blind hatred
If youd stop a while
And maybe if youd smile
You would realize that
Were all the same

Its just like our brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain





Ashley 
Are you running around 
Now youre crying at a bloody murder 
Ashley 
Are you bumming around 
You are crying on my cold shoulder 

Used a tangled mind with your puppet strings 
You tangled your desires right in front of my face 
You let me into the world but wouldnt let me drink 
Swallowing my pride and I never even got the taste 

But time comes around and Im not so naive 
Ive finally lost touch cause youre so out of reach 
You say that youre fine but I know that you aint 
Youre looking like hell and youre no fucking saint

Now youre crying at a bloody murder 
Ashley 
Are you bumming around 
You are crying on my cold shoulder 

You are what you are 
A wish on a shooting star 
You are a filthy thought 
In my memory 

Ive tasted cigarettes and liquor on your breath 
You used to call it speed but now its crystal meth 
Like when I loved you but youre scaring me to death 
This careless memory 
And now I could care less 

But time comes around and Im not so naive 
Ive finally lost touch cause youre so out of reach 
You say that youre fine but I know that you aint 
Youre looking like hell and youre no fucking saint

 She puts her makeup on
  Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
  Shes got her little book of conspiracies
  Right in her hand
  She is paranoid like
  Endangered species headed into extinction
  She is one of a kind
  Shes the last of the American girls


 She wears her overcoat
  For the coming of the nuclear winter
  She is riding her bike
  Like a fugitive of critical mass
  Shes on a hunger strike
  For the ones who wont make it for dinner
  She makes enough to survive
  For a holiday of working class

 Shes a runaway of the establishment incorporated
  She wont cooperate
    Shes the last of the American girls

 She plays her vinyl records
  Singing songs on the eve of destruction
  Shes a sucker for
  All the criminals breaking the laws
  She will come in first
  For the end of western civilization
  Shes an endless war
  Like a hero for the lost cause
  Like a hurricane
  In the heart of the devastation
  Shes a natural disaster

Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit
Hope theres more in your pants than a bus route
Red velvet walls line the sugarcoated halls
Girls hang on bar stools for late last calls
This town is filled with snakes mistakes and whiskey shakes
Its too late I already cut the brakes

If you wanna explore my vocal cord
Leave the girl a gogo dance in the cooch
One hand on my knee one hand on the hooch

And only when I tell ya Will it be time to go

I got under the grip
between the modern hell
I got the rejection letter in the mail and
it was already ripped to shreds
Seasons in a ruin and
This bitter pill is chased with blood
Theres fire in my vein
And its not pouring out like a flood

Whoa Christians inferno
Whoa Christians inferno
Whoa Christians inferno
Whoa Christians inferno

This diabolic state is gracing my existence
Like a catasrophic baby
Maybe Maybe youre the chemical reaction
I am the atom bomb
I am the chosen one
Toxin your reservoir
And then return man to ape

Whoa Christians inferno
Whoa Christians inferno
Whoa Christians inferno
Whoa Christians inferno


Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About NOTHING and EVERYTHING all at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think Im CRACKING UP
Am I just PARANOID
Or am I just STONED

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
SHE says its lack of sex
thats bringing me down
I went to a whore
HE said my lifes a bore
So quit my whining cause
its bringing HER down

Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think Im CRACKING UP
Am I just PARANOID
Uhyuhyuhya

Grasping to CONTROL
So I BETTER hold on

Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think Im CRACKING UP
Am I just PARANOID
Or am I just STONED

All my life trouble follows me
Like a mystery girl
Ive been chasing down a memory
Like a mystery girl

Ive been getting lost searching my soul
All around this town
I took a wrong turn at growing up
And its freaking me out

Back at school it never made much sense
Now I pay but I cant pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life

Too dumb to die I guess
But thats the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex drugs and violence
English math and science 
Safety in numbers
Gimme gimme danger

Well I dont wanna be an imbecile
But Jesus made me that way

All my life Ive been running wild
Like a runaway
Where the night takes me
Like a stowaway

Back at home it never made much sense
Now I pay but I cant pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life

Too dumb to die I guess
But thats the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex drugs and violence
English math and science 
Safety in numbers
Gimme gimme danger

Back at home it never made much sense
Now I pay but I cant pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life

Too dumb to die I guess
But thats the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex drugs and violence
English math and science 
Safety in numbers
Gimme gimme danger

Sex drugs and violence

I see you down in the front line 
Such a sight for sore eyes youre a suicide makeover 
Plastic eyes lookin through a numbskull 
Selfeffaced whats his face 
You erased yourself so shut up 
You dont let up 

You have a growth that must be treated 
Like a severed severe pain in the neck 
You can smell it but you cant see it 
No explanation identified cause you dont know 
You dont say 

And you got no reply 
Hey you where did you come from 
Got a head full of lead youre an inbred bastard son 
All dressed up redblooded a mannequin 
Do or die no reply dont deny that youre synthetic 
Youre pathetic
Where did you come from
Where have you been
Looks like you fell into the trash bin

Im catching a train
Im crashin the car
Back in for daylight
Shooting for the stars

Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
Rat inside a maze
Ive got no destination

Cause Im a little boy named Train
Ask me again and Ill tell you the same
Little boy named Train
Dont know where I come from
But I know where I have been

Serious people are funny to me
Funny people seem so serious
Im always lost and nothing will change
Give me directions and Ill get lost again

Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
Rat inside a maze
Ive got no destination

Cause Im a little boy named Train
Ask me again and Ill tell you the same
Little boy named Train
Dont know where I come from
But I know where I have been

Say

Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
Rat inside a maze
Ive got no destination

Cause Im a little boy named Train
Ask me again and Ill tell you the same
Little boy named Train
I dont know where I come from
But I know where I have been

I said I dont know where I come from
But I know where I have been
Virginia was a lot lizard from FLA
She had a compund fracture in the trunk
It started when she ran away
Thumbs out on the interstate
She hitched a ride to Misery

Mr Whirly had a catastrophic incident
He fell into the city by the bay
He liquidated his estate
Now he sleeps up on the Haight
Panhandling Misery

And hes gonna get high high high
When hes low low low
The fire burns from better days
And she screams why oh why
I said I dont know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of Misery

Well Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam 
He ran the drug cartel in Tinsel Town 
They found him in a Cadillac
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat 
In the name of Misery

Then Gina hit the road to New York City
Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked
She stopped in Vegas to elope
With Virginia and a dope
Who kissed the bride eternally

And theyre gonna get high high high
When theyre low low low
The fire burns from better days
And she screams why oh why
I said I dont know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of Misery

Well hells hounds on your trail now once again boy 
Its groping on your leg until it sleeps 
The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow 
Cuz its not what you make its what you leave

And were gonna get high high high
When were low low low
The fire burns from better days
And she screams why oh why
I said I dont know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of Misery


St Jimmys comin down across the alleyway 
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade 
Light of the silhouette 
Hes insubordinate 
Coming at you on account of 
  

My name is Jimmy 
And you better not wear it out 
Suicide commando that your momma talked about 
King of the forty theives 
And Im here to represent 
That needle in the vein of the establishment 

Im the patron saint of the denial 
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal 

Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope 
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allen Poe 
Raised in the city in the hail of lights 
The product of war and fear that weve been victimized

Im the patron saint of the denial 
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal 

You talkin to me 

Ill give you something to cry about 

ST JIMMY 

My name is St Jimmy Im a son of a gun 
Im the one thats from the way outside
A teenage assasin executing some fun 
In the cult of the life of crime 

I really hate to say it 
But I told you so 
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down old boy 
Welcome to the club and give me some blood 
And the resident leader 
At the lost and found 

Its comedy and tragedy 
Its St Jimmy 
And thats my nameeeeeee 
 and dont wear it out


Gonna ride the world like a merrygoround 
Like a Ferris wheel thats breakin down 
Drinkin angels piss gonna crash and burn 
I just want some action so give me my turn 

Like a Chinese company conspiracy 
Its the death of a nuclear family staring up at you 
Its looking like another bad comedy 
Just as long as it comes
In highfidelity for me too

Can you hear the sound coming over the hill 
Gotta move my feet its coming in for the kill 
Bbaby baby its a blow out Oh yeah 
Like a nuclear bomb and it wont be long til I detonate 

Like a Chinese company conspiracy 
Its the death of a nuclear family staring up at you 
Its looking like another bad comedy 
Just as long as it comes
In highfidelity for me too

Gonna ride the world like a merrygoround 
Like a Ferris wheel thats breakin down 
Scream scream screaming bloody murder Oh yeah 
Like a nuclear bomb and it wont be long til I detonate 

Like a Chinese company conspiracy 
Its the death of a nuclear family staring up at you 
Its looking like another bad comedy 
Just as long as it comes
In highfidelity for me too





I declare I dont care no more 
Im burning up and out and growing bored 
In my smoked out boring room 
My hair is shagging in my eyes 
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight 
To drive along these shit town lights 

Im not growing up 
Im just burning out 
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead 

Apathy has rained on me 
Now Im feeling like a soggy dream 
So close to drowning but 
I dont mind Ive lived in this mental cave 
Throw emotions in the grave 
Hell who needs them anyway

Im not growing up 
Im just burning out 
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
Im taking down all my enemies
 Cause theyre all so fucking useless
 A bunch of shit talking drama queens
 And theyre all filled with excuses

I wanna find me a better scene
 Where its not the same opinion
 Id rather go to a funeral
 Than to this high school reunion

April Fool
 Thought youre falling in love
 But now youre sucking on a doorknob
 That I slammed in your face
 Lifes a cruel crushing bastard crime
 Youre a stupid mother fucker
 And youre doing the time

Were all crazy
 Youre all crazy now
 Well were so crazy
 Youve all gone insane
 Loss of control

Hanging out all by myself
 At least I make good company
 Hey isnt that old whats his face
 That I see walking down the street

Im gonna hide in the shadows
 Cause I really got nothing to say
 We never had anything in common
 And I never liked you anyway

April Fool
 Thought you were falling in love
 But now youre sucking on a doorknob
 That I slammed in your face
 Lifes a cruel crushing son of a bitch
 And youre a stupid mother fucker
 Serving shit to the pigs

Were all crazy
 Youre all crazy now
 Well were so crazy
 Youve all gone insane
 Loss of control

April Fool
 Thought youre falling in love
 But now youre sucking on a doorknob
 That I slammed in your face
 Lifes a cruel crushing bastard crime
 Youre a stupid mother fucker
 And youre doing the time

Were all crazy
 Youre all crazy now
 Well were so crazy
 Youve all gone insane
 Loss of control 


Chorus
Dreaming
I am only dreaming
Of another place and time
Where my familys from
Singing
I can hear them singing
When the rain had washed away
All these scattered dreams
Dying
Everyones reminded
Hearts are washed in misery
Drenched in gasoline
Laughter
There is no more laughter
Songs of yesterday
Now live in the underground

Life before the lobotomy
Christian sang the eulogy
Sign my love a lost memory
From the end of the century

Well its enough to make you sick
To cast a stone and throw a brick
When the sky is falling down
It burned your dreams into the ground

Christians lesson is what hes been sold
We are normal and selfcontrolled
Remember to learn to forget
Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes

Well Im not stoned
Im just fucked up
I got so high I cant stand up
Im not cursed cause Ive been blessed
Im not in love cause Im a mess

Life refuges
Were lost like refugees
Like refugees
Were lost like refugees
The brutality of reality
Is the freedom that keeps me from dreaming

Chorus
Dreaming
I am only dreaming
Of another place and time
Where my familys from
Singing
I can hear them singing
When the rain had washed away
All these scattered dreams
Dying
Everyones reminded
Hearts are washed in misery
Drenched in gasoline
Laughter
There is no more laughter
Songs of yesterday
Now live in the underground



Now I rest my head from
Such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness
That had you on my mind
Those days are gone and now it seems
As if Ill get some rest
But now and then Ill see you again
And it puts my heart to test

So when are all my troubles going to end 
Im understanding now that we are only friends
To this day Im asking why
I still think about you

As the days go on I wonder
will this ever end 
I find it hard to keep control
When youre with your boyfriend
I do not mind if all I am is
Just a friend to you
But all I want to know right now
Is if you think about me too 

So when are all my troubles going to end 
Im understanding now that we are only friends
To this day Im asking why
I still think about you

Paper Lanterns

Now I rest my head from such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness that had you on my mind
Those days are gone and now it seems
As if Ill get some rest but now and then Ill see you again
And it puts my heart to test

So when are all my troubles going to end 
Im understanding now that we are only friends
To this day Im asking why
I still think about you

As the days go on I wonder will this ever end 
I find it hard to keep control when youre with your boyfriend
I do not mind if all I am is just a friend to you
But all I want to know right now
Is if you think about me too 

So when are all my troubles going to end 
Im understanding now that we are only friends
To this day Im asking why
I still think about you


Seventeen and strung out on confusion
 Trapped inside a roll of disillusion
 I found out what it takes to be a man
 Well Mom and Dad will never understand

Secrets collecting dust but never forget
 SKELETONS come to LIFE in my closet

I found out what it takes to be a man
 Well Mom and Dad will never understand
 WHATS HAPPENING TO ME

Seventeen and COMING CLEAN for the first time
 I finally figured out myself for the first time
 I found out what it takes to be a man
 Well Mom and Dad will never understand
 WHATS HAPPENING TO ME

To know you is to hate you
So loving you must be like suicide
I dont mind if you dont mind
Im not the one thats going to die

I guess I just cant listen
To this one sided conversation again
cause I dont care if I dont care
No one ever said that life is fair

Everybody loves a joke
But no one likes a fool
And youre always cracking the same old lines again
Youre well rehearsed on every verse
And that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity

The center of attention
Got an honerable mention once again
Congratulations and salutations
Youre a figment of your own imagination

Everybody loves a joke
But no one likes a fool
And youre always cracking the same old lines again
Youre well rehearsed on every verse
And that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity

To know you is to bait you
And you fell victim to your own denial
I dont mind if you dont mind
If youre wasting all your time

Youre a figment of your own imagination 

Everybody loves a joke 
But no one likes a fool 
And youre always cracking the same old lines again 
Youre well rehearsed on every verse 
And that was stated clear 
But no one understands your verity 

To know you is to bait you 
And you fell victim to your own denial 
I dont mind if you dont mind 
If youre wasting all your time


Verse 
Im like a child looking off in the horizon
Im like an ambulance thats turning on the sirens
Oh Im still alive
Im like a soldier coming home for the first time
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine
Oh Im still alive
Am I bleeding Am I bleeding from the storm
Just shine a light into the wreckage so far away away

Chorus
Cause Im still breathing
Cause Im still breathing on my own
My heads above the rain and roses
Making my way my way
Cause Im still breathing
Cause Im still breathing on my own
My heads above the rain and roses
Making my way my way
My way to you

Verse 
Im like a junkie tying off for the last time
Im like a loser thats betting on his last dime
Oh Im still alive
Im like a son that was raised without a father
Im like a mother barely keeping it together
Oh Im still alive
Am I bleeding Am I bleeding from the storm
Just shine a light into the wreckage so far away away

Chorus
Cause Im still breathing
Cause Im still breathing on my own
My heads above the rain and roses
Making my way my way
Cause Im still breathing
Cause Im still breathing on my own
My heads above the rain and roses
Making my way my way my way

Bridge
As I walked out on the ledge
Are you scared to death to live
I been running all my life
Just to find a home thats for the restless
And the truth thats in the message
Making my way away away

Chorus
Cause Im still breathing
Cause Im still breathing on my own
My heads above the rain and roses
Making my way my way
Cause Im still breathing
Cause Im still breathing on my own
My heads above the rain and roses
Making my way my way my way
Cause Im still breathing
Cause Im still breathing on my own
My heads above the rain and roses
Making my way my way
My way to you
I sit around and watch the tube but nothings on
 I change the channels for an hour or two
 Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
 Im sick of all the same old shit
 In a house with unlocked doors 
 And Im fucking lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
 Take me away to paradise
 Im so damn bored Im going blind
 And I smell like shit

Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
 I sure as hell cant do it by myself
 Im feeling like a dog in heat
 Barred indoors from the summer street
 I locked the door to my own cell 
 And I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
 Take me away to paradise
 Im so damn bored Im going blind
 And I smell like shit

I got no motivation
 Where is my motivation
 No time for the motivation
 Smoking my inspiration

I sit around and watch the phone 
 But no ones calling
 Call me pathetic call me what you will
 My mother says to get a job
 But she dont like the one shes got
 When masturbations lost its fun 
 Youre fucking lonely

So bite my lip and close my eyes
 Take me away to paradise
 Im so damn bored Im going blind
 And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes
 Im slipping away to paradise
 Some say quit or Ill go blind
 But its just a myth






Amanda dont you know
That I still walk around
This foggy roundabout
When I get back in town
I was a different man
From five seconds ago
And youre a different woman
Thats for certain
I dont know a thing about

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand
Amanda I couldnt be your man

Amanda dont you know
I wasnt strong enough
And in your wild mind
I wasnt smart enough
I was a different kid
From fifteen years ago
And youre a different woman
Thats for certain
I wanna know about

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand
Amanda I couldnt be your man

Im not playin with your mind
Unless you think I am
Cause youre crushing my heart
Like a battering ram

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand
Amanda I couldnt be your man


Amanda

Amanda dont you know

Im too tired to be bored
Im too bored to be tired
And the silence is so deafening
Its like picking at a sore

Im too mental to go crazy
Im too drunk to be pure
And my mind is playing tricks on me
And I cant sleep tonight
Cuz Im so tired

I cant take it anymore
And with all the liars
Like a prisoner of war

I dont want your sympathy
I dont want your honesty
I just wanna get some peace of mind

Its only in my head
As I role over and play dead
I dont wanna hear it anymore

Its good to see you
But I really must admit
Theres an odor in the air
And I think you look like shit

I cant stand from falling down
Im too sick to throw up
Everyone keeps talking
And they cant shut the fuck up
Cuz Im so tired

I cant take it anymore
And with all the liars
Like a prisoner of war

I dont want your sympathy
I dont want your honesty
I just wanna get some peace of mind

Its only in my head
As I role over and play dead
I dont wanna hear it anymore

I dont want your sympathy
I dont want your honesty
I just wanna get some peace of mind

Its only in my head
As I role over and play dead
I dont wanna hear about it
I dont wanna scream about it
I dont wanna hear it any more
Come together like a foot in a shoe 
Only this time I think I stuck my foot in my mouth 
Thinking out loud and acting in vain 
Knocking over anyone that stands in my way 

Sometimes I need to apologize 
Sometimes I need to admit that I aint right 
Sometimes I should just keep my mouth shut or only say hello 
Sometimes I still feel Im walking alone 

Walk on eggshells on my old stomping ground 
Yet theres really no one left thats hanging around 
Isnt that another familiar face 
Too drunk to figure out theyre fading away
Ill drop your laundry and slam the door
 I dont want your love so give me more
 Im a beggar but I dont want a dime

Oh baby baby its fuck time
 You know I really wanna make you mine
 Oh baby baby its fuck time
 Theres nothing left to say

Take a look into my eyes
 I wanna hold you til youre paralyzed

Oh Amanda Jones your holy grace
 I wanna choke you til youre blue in the face
 Your dirty thoughts and a dirty mind

Oh baby baby its fuck time
 You know I really wanna make you mine
 Oh baby baby its fuck time
 Theres nothing left to say

Take a look into my eyes
 I wanna hold you til youre paralyzed

Take a look into my eyes
 I wanna hold you til youre paralyzed
 Take a look into my eyes
 I wanna hold you til youre paralyzed 



Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone
The worry rock has turned to dust and fallen on our pride

A knocked down dragged out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
And no one will take the fall

Where do we go from here 
And what did you do with the directions 
Promise me no dead end streets 
And Ill guarantee well have the road

A knocked down dragged out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
And no one will take the fall

Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud
Where do we go from here 
And what did you do with the directions 
Promise me no dead end streets 
And Ill guarantee well have the road
And Ill guarantee well have the road
And Ill guarantee well have the road
Starlit night
The moon is shining bright
You are the one I need
Up at your window
I see a shadow
Silhouette of your grace
Heres this flower
I picked for all the hours
That youve spent with me
The one I love
That Ive been dreaming of
Sailing across the sea

Let my hands flow through
Your hair 
Moving closer
A kiss well share
Passionate love to be all night long
Well never break 
As one too strong

Nothings more
Than what our love is for
As I kiss your cheek
Oh so softly
Hands flowing down my back
 hours Ill never leave
Our romance
Is a love trance
And now well never part
 hours
Of such a love shower
Well never stop once we start

Let my hands flow through
Your hair 
Moving closer
A kiss well share
Passionate love to be all night long
Well never break 
As one too strong

Let my hands flow through
Your hair 
Moving closer
A kiss well share
Passionate love to be all night long
Well never break 
As one too strong

Born into Nixon I was raised in hell
A welfare child where the Teamsters dwelled
The last one born and the first one to run
My town was blind from refinery sun

Chorus
My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero
st century breakdown
I was once lost but never was found
I think I am losing whats left of my mind
To the th century deadline

I was made of posion and blood
Condemnation is what I understood
Videogames of the towers fall
Homeland security could kill us all

Chorus

We are the cries of the class of thirteen
Born in the era of humility
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 

My name is No One the long lost son
Born on the th of July
Raised in the era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive

I am a nation a worker of pride
My debt to status quo
The scars on my hands and the means to an end
Is all that I have to show

I swallowed my pride and I chocked on my faith
Ive given my heart and my soul
Ive broken my fingers and lied through my teeth 
The pillar of damage control

Ive been to the edge and Ive thrown the bouquet
Of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room wasting my time
And waiting for Judgement Day

I praise liberty
The Freedom to Obey
Is the song that strangles me
Dont cross the line

Dream American Dream
I cant even sleep
From the lights early dawn

Scream America scream
Believe what you see
From heroes and cons

Verse 
Scream with your hands up in the sky
Like you want to testify
For the life thats been deleted
Sing like a rebels lullaby
Under the stars and stripes
For the lost souls that were cheated
We will be seen but not be heard

Chorus
We are Revolution Radio
Operation No Control
And the headline My loves bullet proof
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline Legalize the truth

Verse 
Give me rage like theres teargas in the crowd
Do you wanna live out loud
But the air is barely breathing
Rise of the slums to the obsolete
The dawn of the new airwaves for the antisocial media

Chorus
We are Revolution Radio
Operation No Control
And the headline My loves bullet proof
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline Legalize the truth

We will be seen but not be heard
We are the songs of the disturbed

Chorus
We are Revolution Radio
Operation No Control
And the headline My loves bullet proof
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline Legalize the truth
I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted in a daze
It should seem obvious to you
Your screams and cries are never going to work
And all of your time gets wasted in my daze

And Im looking back now at where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing to break from these chains
These chains that control 
My futures aim

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted in a daze
Maybe Im just too damn lazy
Or maybe I was just brainwashed 
To think that way
And all of your time gets wasted in my daze

And Im looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break from these chains
These chains that control
My futures aim


 In Your Coffeemaker

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted 
In a daze
It should seem obvious to you
Your screams and cries are never going to work
And all of your time gets wasted 
In my daze

And Im looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along my interests are longing
To break from these chains these chains that control my futures aim

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted in a daze
Maybe Im just too damn lazy
Or maybe I was just brainwashed 
To think that way
And all of your time gets wasted 
In my daze

And Im looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along my interests are longing
To break from these chains these chains that control my futures aim








Shoplifter youll never learn
When you commit the crime
Shoplifter youre getting burned
And now you gotta do the time

Its a  on the felony
Well not everything is free
Now that you served the community
Its the life of a Burley thief

Its not considered stealing
Unless youre getting caught
But youve been caught stealing
Tryin to take something you havent got

Shoplifter youll never learn
What lies behind your back
Not a burglar or a bank robber
Just a kleptomaniac

Its not considered stealing
Unless youre getting caught
But youve been caught stealing
Tryin to take something you havent got

Shoplifter youll never learn
When you commit the crime
Shoplifter youre getting burned
And now you gotta do the time
And now you gotta do the time
And now you gotta do some time
Uncomfortable silence
Ill kill it if you want me to
Im like ultraviolet
Ill kill it if you want me to

Out of sight out of mind
Im not the hurting kind
Ill make you surrender x

Stop when the red lights flash
Ill trade you blood for dirty cash
Life in the catacombs
You make me feel like Im at home

Out of sight out of mind
Im not the hurting kind
Ill make you surrender x

Out of sight out of mind
Just give in one more time
Ill make you surrender x
All brawn and no brains
And all those nice things
You finally got what you want
Someone to look good with
And light your cigarette
Is this what you really want 

I figured out what youre all about
And I dont think I like what I see
SOOOOO
I hope I wont be there
In the end if you come around

How long will he last
Before hes a creep in the past
And youre alone once again
Will you pop up again and be my
special friend till the end
And when will that be

I figured out what youre all about
And I dont think I like what I see
SOOOOO
I hope I wont be there
In the end if you come around



Waking up feeling naked
In my clothes inside a room thats vacant
Lost my nerve its unnerving
I know there is something Im forgetting

I searched the moon I lost my head 
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls I hit the streets
Im pounding the pavement looking

Im missing you
Im missing you
Youre not around and Im a complete disaster
Im missing you

Remember was our first time
I told you I loved you at the bus station
Dont forget cause its not over
Im not lost cuz Im just missing you

I searched the moon I lost my head 
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls I hit the streets
Im pounding the pavement looking

Im missing you
Im missing you
Youre not around and Im a complete disaster
Im missing you

Say hey 

Well shes my bud
And shes my soul
I get so lost
Out in the cold

Feels so far
Like this lone star
It gets so hard
When Im missing you

Im missing you
Im missing you
Youre not around and Im a fuckin disaster
Im missing you
 am Im drunk again
My head is standing underneath my puke
So make it stop Im getting off
Make it stop Im getting off

Sedatives and dizzy spells
And spilling my guts beneath my puke
So make it stop Im getting off
Make it stop Im getting off

Well slipped into a coma once again
Wheres my organ donor to lend a hand

So when you think youre all alone
No ones left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate suffocate suffocate

One night stands and cheap regrets
I take another drag off of my cigarette
So stop Im getting off
Make it stop Im getting off

One last stop for one track mind
Just give me shelter give me give me something
Make it stop Im getting off
Make it stop Im getting off

Well slipped into a coma once again
Wheres my organ donor to lend a hand

So when you think youre all alone
No ones left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate suffocate suffocate

So when you think youre all alone
No ones left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate suffocate suffocate
I dont wanna go back home
I dont wanna kiss goodnight
Let us paralyze this moment
til it dies

To the end of the earth
Under the valley of the stars
Theres a car crashing
Deep inside my heart

Take a ride to the avenues
Across the Great Divide
Theres a siren screaming
Im alive it cries

Red alert is the color
Of your paper valentines
Intertwined on this moment
Passing by

Take a ride through the avenues
Across the Great Divide
Theres a siren screaming
Im alive it cries

Red alert is the color
Of your paper valentines
Intertwined on this moment
Passing by

Oh come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines

Cigarettes and valentines

So come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines

Oh come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines

Cigarettes and valentines
Do you know whats worth fighting for
When its not worth dying for
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide
Did someone break your heart inside
Youre in ruins

One guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When youre at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesnt pass
Nothings ever built to last
Youre in ruins

One guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home 
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

When its time to live and let die
And you cant get another try
Something inside this heart has died
Youre in ruins

One guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One guns
Throw up your arms into the sky 

One guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

 OST Transformers Revenge of the Fallen   

 OST The Vampire Diaries   
You gotta problem you just cant hide
Compulsive habits that never seem to die
Your breath has taken up all the air
Your teeth are rotting 
To black holes in your head

Well reality is due 
What you say just cant be true
When the story is stretched and so farfetched
That youre lacking an excuse

You lied

Your mother allowed you 
For just one white lie
But now shes dead
And she left you with a problem
Pinocchio has pierced your tongue
Your nose is growin
Into the rd dimension

Well reality is due 
What you say just cant be true
When the story is stretched and so farfetched
That youre lacking an excuse

You lied

Well reality is due 
What you say just cant be true
When the story is stretched and so farfetched
That youre lacking an excuse

You lied
Oh oh I love you
Oh oh I do
I got a sentimental illness for you
Please dont go away oh yeah

I was a high school atom bomb
Going off on the weekends
Smoking dope and mowing lawns
And I hated all the new trends
Me and my friends sang
Woahuhohohoh woahuhoh
Heres to the middle of the road
At least its better than here

Looking for a cause
But all I got was Santa Claus
Im hanging on a dream 
Thats too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high too scared to dream
But too dumb to die

My daddy always was on strike
Going off with the teamsters
He said that everything will be alright
Not every Sunday can be Easter
The picket line screamed
Woahuhohohoh woahuhoh
Dont cross dont cross the line
Because youll be a scab not a martyr

x
Looking for a cause
But all I got was Camouflage
Im hanging on a dream 
Thats too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high too scared to dream
But too dumb to

Die



Where in the worlds the forgotten
Theyre lost inside your memory
Youre dragging on your hearts been broken
As we all go down in history

Where in the world did the time go
Its where your spirit seems to roam
Like losing faith to our abandon
Or an empty hallway from a broken home

Well dont look away from the arms of a bad dream
Dont look away 
Sometimes youre better lost than to be seen

I dont feel strange its more like haunted
Another moment trapped in time
I cant quite put my finger on it
But its like a child that was left behind

So where in the worlds the forgotten
Like soldiers from a long lost war
We share the scars from our abandon
And what we remember becomes folk lore

Well dont look away from the arms of a bad dream
Dont look away 
Sometimes youre better lost than to be seen

Dont look away from the arms of a moment
Dont look away from the arms of tomorrow
Dont look away from the arms of a moment
Dont look away from the arms of love

Well dont look away from the arms of a bad dream
Dont look away 
Sometimes youre better lost than to be seen

Dont look away from the arms of a moment
Dont look away from the arms of tomorrow
Dont look away from the arms of a moment
Dont look away from the arms of love


 OST The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part     
Hey mister where you headed
Are you in a hurry
Need a lift to happy hour
Say oh no
Do you brake for distilled spirits
I need a break as well
The well that inebriates the guilt
   

Cold turkeys getting stale tonight Im eating crow
Fermented salmonella poison oak no

Theres a drought at the fountain of youth and now Im dehydrating
My tongue is swelling up as say   
Troubled times you know I can not lie
Im off the wagon and Im hitchin a ride

Theres a drought at the fountain of youth and now Im dehydrating
My tongue is swelling up I say shit

Troubled times you know I can not lie
Im off the wagon and Im hitchin a ride

Im hitchin a ride
Im hitchin a ride
Im hitchin a ride
Im hitchin a ride
Im hitchin a ride
Im hitchin a ride
Im hitchin a ride


Chorus
I want to be the minority 
I dont need your authority 
Down with the moral majority 
Cause I want to be the minority 

I pledge allegiance to the underworld 
One nation under dog 
There of which I stand alone 
A face in the crowd 
Unsung against the mold 
Without a doubt 
Singled out 
The only way I know 

Chorus
I want to be the minority 
I dont need your authority 
Down with the moral majority 
Cause I want to be the minority 

Stepped out of the line 
Like a sheep runs from the herd 
Marching out of time 
To my own beat now 
The only way I know 

One light one mind 
Flashing in the dark 
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts 
For crying out loud she screamed unto me 
A free for all 
Fuck em all 
You are your own sight 

Chorus
I want to be the minority 
I dont need your authority 
Down with the moral majority 
Cause I want to be the minority 


Breaking rocks in the hot sun 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the law won 
I needed the money cause I had none 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the law won 

I miss my baby and I feel so sad
I guess my race is run 
Well shes the best girl that I ever had 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the

Robin people with a six gun 
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and I miss my fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I miss my baby and I feel so sad
I guess my race is run
Why shes the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the

I fought the law and the law won x
I fought the law and the
I was a young boy that had big plans
Now Im just another shitty old man
I dont have fun and I hate everything
This world owes me so fuck you

Glory days dont mean shit to me
I drank a six pack of apathy
Lifes a bitch and so am I
The world owes me so fuck you

Wasted youth and a fistful of ideas
I had a young and optimistic point of view
Wasted youth and a fistful of ideas
I had a young and optimistic point of view

Ive decomposed yet my guts getting fat
Oh my God Im turning out like my Dad
Im always rude Ive a bad attitude
The world owes me so fuck you

The wifes a nag and the kids fucking up
I dont have sex cause I cant get it up
Im just a grouch sitting on the couch
The world owes me so fuck you


Raise your hands now to testify
Your confession will be crucified
Youre a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog thats been sodomized
Stand up All the white boys
Sit down All the black girls
Youre the soldiers of the new world

Put your faith in miracle
And its nondenominational
Join the choir we will be singing
In the church of wishful thinking

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Oh bless me lord for I have sinned
Its been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in The River
Of a Shadow of Doubt
And ill be dressed in my Sunday best

Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Aint this uniform so flattering
I never asked you a god damned thing

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Dont test me
Second guess me
Protest me
You will disappear

I want to know whos allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read
Missionary politicians
And the cops of a new religion

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the inside


Can you hear the sound of the static noise
Blasting out in stereo
Cater to the class and the paranoid
Music to my nervous system
Advertising love and religion
Murder on the airwaves
Slogans on the brink of corruption
Vision of blasphemy war and peace
Screaming at you

I cant see a thing in the video
I cant hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

Billboard on the rise in the dawns landscape
Working your insanity
Tragic ala madness and concrete
Coca cola execution
Conscience on a cross and
Your hearts on a vice
Squeezing out your state of mind
Are what you own that you cannot buy
What a fucking tragedy strategy
Screaming at you

I cant see a thing in the video
I cant hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I cant see a thing in the video
I cant hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

Hey hey its the static age
This is how the west was won
Hey hey its the static age millennium

All I want to know
Its a goddamned thing
Not whats in the medicine
All I want to do is
I want to breathe
Batteries are not included
Whats the latest way that a man can die
Screaming hallelujah
Singing out the dawns early light
The silent of the rotten forgotten
Screaming at you

I cant see a thing in the video
I cant hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I cant see a thing in the video
I cant hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I cant see a thing in the video
I cant hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I cant see a thing in the video
I cant hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age
The static age


Juliets trying to find out what she wants but she dont know
Experience has got her down
Look this direction I know its not perfection its just me
I want to bring you up again now

Cause Im losing whats left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that youre happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

Juliets crying cause now 
Shes realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again now

Cause Im losing whats left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that youre happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

Juliets crying cause now 
Shes realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again somehow

Cause Im losing whats left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that youre happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in



Well I met a girl named Lady Cobra
Her black heart beats crimson and clover
She gives me chills and fever blisters
Shes serving spells and voodoo shakes

Well she just wants to get me high
Stick a needle in my eye
Reeks like hell lost in temptation rubbing on my inner demons
I dont wanna suicide I dont want this to end
I just wanna be your friend

Cuddle up with me real tight
Talk to me by candlelight
Do you wanna play a game of Twister
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter
I dont wanna suicide I dont want this to end
I just wanna be your friend

I dont want to make you cry
Cross my heart and hope to die
Drawin blood and lonely stars
Drinking piss for cheap guitars
I dont wanna suicide I dont want this to end
I just want to be your friend

Oh your friend



Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame Hey 
The shame the ones who died without a name 

Hear the dogs howlin out of key
To a hymn called Faith and Misery Hey 
And plead the company lost the war today 

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 
On holiday 

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protestor has crossed the line Hey 
To find the moneys on the other side

Can I get another Amen Amen
Theres a flag wrapped around the score of men Hey 
A gag a plastic bag on a monument 

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 
On holiday 

The representative from California has the floor

Zeig Heil to the president gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass man
Kill all the fags that dont agree
Triumph by fires setting fire
Its not a way thats meant for me
Just cause
Just cuz were on holiday

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives


Every time Im falling down
You take the repurcussions
Headaches and anxieties
Advancing my frustrations

Rush into my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well now youre stuck with me

Hand up your soul to my wrist
And Ill vow my trust to you
Moving on and I always thought
I realized youve imagined

You take the repurcussions
Headaches and anxieties
Advancing my frustrations

Rush into my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well now youre stuck with me

Hand up your soul to my wrist
And Ill vow my trust to you
Moving on and I always thought
I realized youve imagined
Late last night I had a dream
And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that shell dry the tears
Left on my face Ive cried

Oh I love her keep dreaming of her
Will I understand if she wants 
To be my friend

Id send a letter to that girl
Asking her to be my own
But my pen is writing wrong
So Ill say it in a song
Oh I love you more right now
More than Ive ever loved before
Heres those words straight from these lips
Ill need you forever more

Oh I love her keep dreaming of her
Will I understand if she wants 
To be my friend

Late last night I had a dream
And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that shell dry fears
Left on my face Ive cried

Oh I love her keep dreaming of her
Will I understand if she wants 
To be my friend


Dry Ice

Late last night I had a dream

Im the son of rage and love
The Jesus of suburbia 
From the bible of none of the above 
On a steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin 
No one ever died for my sins in hell 
As far as I can tell 
At least the ones I got away with 

And theres nothing wrong with me 
This is how Im supposed to be 
In a land of make believe 
That dont believe in me

Get my television fix sitting on my crucifix 
The living room or my private womb 
While the moms and brads are away 
To fall in love and fall in debt 
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane 
To keep me insane and doing someone elses cocaine

And theres nothing wrong with me
This is how Im supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That dont believe in me

At the center of the Earth
In the parking lot 
Of the were I was taught 
The motto was just a lie 
It says home is where your heart is
But what a shame 
Cause everyones heart 
Doesnt beat the same 
Its beating out of time 

City of the dead 
At the end of another lost highway 
Signs misleading to nowhere 
City of the damned 
Lost children with dirty faces today 
No one really seems to care 

I read the graffiti 
In the bathroom stall 
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall 
And so it seemed to confess 
It didnt say much 
But it only confirmed that
The center of the earth 
Is the end of the world 
And I could really care less 

City of the dead
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to careeeeee

I dont care if you dont 
I dont care if you dont
I dont care if you dont care
x

I dont careeeeeeeeee

Everyone is so full of shit 
Born and raised by hypocrites 
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave 
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the middle east 
We are the stories and disciples 
Of the Jesus of suburbia 
Land of make believe 
And it dont believe in me 
Land of make believe 
And I dont believe 
And I dont care 
I dont care x

Dearly beloved are you listening
I cant remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed 
The space thats in between insane and insecure 
Oh therapy can you please fill the void 
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed 
Nobodys perfect and I stand accused 
For lack of a better word and thats my best excuse 

To live and not to breathe 
Is to die In tragedy
To run to run away 
To find what you believe 
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies 
I lost my faith to this 
This town that dont exist

So I run 
I run away
To the light of masochist
And I leave behind 
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line 
A million and one fucking times
But not this time

I dont feel any shame
I wont apologize 

When there aint nowhere you can go
Running away from pain
When youve been victimized
Tales from another broken home

Youre leaving
Youre leaving
Youre leaving
Ah youre leaving home

Shes an extraordinary girl
In an ordinary world
And she cant seem to get away

He lacks the courage in his mind
Like a child left behind
Like a pet left in the rain

Shes all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes

Somedays he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying

She sees the mirror of herself
An image she wants to sell
To anyone willing to buy

He steals the image in her kiss
From her hearts apocalypse
From the one called whatsername

Shes all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes

Somedays he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying

Shes all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes

Somedays he feels like dying
Somedays its not worth trying
Now that they both are finding
She gets so sick of crying

Shes an extraordinary girl 
an extraordinary girl 
an extraordinary girl 
an extraordinary girl


Olivia Olivia its raining outside
The city is drenched theres a moon out tonight
Theres a break in the clouds just under the stars
We wanna go out and watch from afar

We couldnt care when and stepped in the mud
It makes no sense but you misunderstood
The city is in ruins but theres a flower in the crack of the streets

Olivia Olivia Ill give you my best
Safe in my arms Ill lay you to rest
You can borrow my coat you wear the dress
Olivia Olivia come follow me home
Hey
Youre giving me a heart attack
Youre giving me a cardiac arrest
When Im standing at the traffic light
Hey
I wanna get inside of you
I wanna crack your cranium delirium
On the lower east side of your mind

Wanna be a Troublemaker

Hey
I like your BMW
I like your BMexcellent tits
With a tattoo of a pig sniffing glue
Hey

Youre looking like a Jezebel hot as hell
Sunburned in a pink bathing suit

Wanna be a Troublemaker

Hey
Yeah
Easy come and go gonna go it alone
Knock yourself out with a shot of Patron
I wouldnt say Im straight
cause Im bent out of shape
From now till death do we party
Just before its too late
Hey
Youre giving me a heart attack
Youre giving me a cardiac arrest
When Im standing at the traffic light

Verse 
 I walk a lonely road
 The only one that I have ever known
 Dont know where it goes
 But its home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
 On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
 Where the city sleeps
 and Im the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone
 I walk alone

Chorus
 My shadows the only one that walks beside me
 My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating
 Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
 Til then I walk alone

Verse 
 Im walking down the line
 That divides me somewhere in my mind
 On the border line
 Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
 Whats fucked up and everythings alright
 Check my vital signs
 To know Im still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone
 I walk alone

Chorus
 My shadows the only one that walks beside me
 My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating
 Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
 Til then I walk alone

 OST Supernatural  
Nice guys finish last
Youre running out of gas
Your sympathy will get you left behind

Sometimes youre at your best
When you look the worst

Do you feel washed up
Like piss going down the drain

Pressure cooker pick my brain 
And tell me Im insane
Im so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have its truth and now the jokes on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy

Oh nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Dont pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine

Living on command
Youre shaking lots of hands
Kissing up and bleeding all your trust
Taking what you need
Bite the hand that feeds
You kill your memory


Part  Im Freaking Out

My name is Billie and Im freaking out
I thought therefore I was
Well I cant really figure it out
I sit alone with my thoughts and prayers
Scream out my memories
As if I was never there

Standing at the edge of the world
Is giving me the chills
Looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tango
Its freaking me out
Burning lights and blackouts

From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

Im like a punk rocker on Labor Day
How the hell did I work so hard
To be born this way
I never learned to read or write so well
Freaking out
But I can play the guitar until it hurts like hell

Standing at the edge of the world
Is giving me the chills
Looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tango
Its freaking me out
Burning lights and blackouts

From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

Part  A Better Way to Die

If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die
If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die

Oh I dont want to think about tomorrow
Dont want to think about it Oh
It doesnt matter anyway
Oh I wanna start a revolution
I want to hear it on my radio
Ill put it off another day

I want a new conspiracy
And the silence of a thousand cries
So hurry up
I want a better way to die

Part  Somewhere Reprise

Im running late to somewhere now
That I dont want to be
Where the future and promises
Aint what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise
Or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side
Ever get so full

Somewhere now x

x
Oh I dont want to think about tomorrow
Dont want to think about it Oh
It doesnt matter anyway
Oh I wanna start a revolution
I want to hear it on my radio
Ill put it off another day

I aint gonna stand in line no more




Waiting in a room
All dressed up and bound and gagged up to a chair 
Its so unfair

I wont dare to move
For the pain she puts me through
What I need
So make it bleed

Im in distress
Oh mistress I confess so do it one more time 
These handcuffs are too tight well 
You know I will obey 
So please dont make me me beg 
For blood sex and booze you give me

Some say Im disturbed
But its what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned
From a girl called kill

My head is in the gutter
Thank you sir strike up another mandolin 
Or discipline 
Throw me to the dogs 
Let them eat my flesh down 
To the wood 
It feels so good

Im in distress
Oh mistress I confess so do it one more time 
These handcuffs are too tight well 
You know I will obey 
So please dont make me me beg 
For blood sex and booze you give me

Say Im disturbed
But its what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned
From a girl called Kill

Im in distress
Oh mistress I confess so do it one more time 
These handcuffs are too tight well 
You know I will obey 
So please dont make me me beg 
For blood sex and booze you give me


Shes always living like shes running out of time
Too much just aint enough to keep her satisfied
Her plastic card is filled with nothing comes to mind
Its now her occupation that shes overqualified

The looks are always so deceiving
The truth is always misconstrued

To you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too

Hes talking shit about how its better way back when
He lives every waking moment as means to an end
We are we are but Im not
I never used to be
So god bless your fucking past and to hell with your glory

The looks are always so deceiving
The truth is always misconstrued

To you 
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too

She packs her bags and says goodbye and bon voyage
Farewell well see you in hell I hope you rest in pieces
Fuck you

Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too



Another turning point
A fork stuck in the road 
Time grabs you by the wrist
Directs you where to go 
So make the best of this test 
And dont ask why 
Its not a question 
But a lesson learned in time 

Chorus
Its something unpredictable 
But in the end is right 
I hope you had the time of your life 

So take the photographs 
And still frames in your mind 
Hang it on a shelf 
Of good health and good time
Tattoos of memories 
And dead skin on trial 
For what its worth 
It was worth all the while 

Chorus x 
Its something unpredictable 
But in the end is right 
I hope you had the time of your life


Time of Your Life Good Riddance

Another turning point
A fork stuck in the road 
Time grabs you by the wrist
Directs you where to go 
So make the best of this test 
And dont ask why 
Its not a question 
But a lesson learned in time 

Chorus
Its something unpredictable 
But in the end is right 
I hope you had the time of your life 

So take the photographs 
And still frames in your mind 
Hang it on a shelf 
Of good health and good time
Tattoos of memories 
And dead skin on trial 
For what its worth 
It was worth all the while 

Its something unpredictable 
But in the end is right 
I hope you had the time of your life 

Chorus x



Wake up the house is on fire
And the cats caught in the dryer
Philosophys a liar when
Your home is your headstone
Icon is the last chance for hope
Your faith lied in the ditch that you dug yourself in

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down

Deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay
Theres a vacant sign thats hanging high
On a noose over you home

Deadbeat holiday get on you knees and pray
Theres a vacant sign thats hanging high
But at least youre not alone

Christmas lights in the middle of August
Grudges comes back to haunt us
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies
Grounded in a duplex to find that
Youre living on a landmine
Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down

Deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay
Theres a vacant sign thats hanging high
On a noose over you home

Deadbeat holiday get on you knees and pray
Theres a vacant sign thats hanging high
But at least youre not alone

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay when all you
Want to do is Not togive up
Smell your technicolour in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it like its so enlightening staring at the sun thats blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky

Dressed to the nines like a black cats eyes
Youre such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud

And it goes

Wearing a psychotic red alert
Your bouquet of flowers in the dirt
Radioactive and primal Nuclear and so delightful
Wearing dayglo where you know it hurts

Dressed to the nines like a black cats eyes
Youre such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud

And it goes

Smell your technicolour in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it like its so enlightening staring at the sun thats blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky

Dressed to the nines like a black cats eyes
Youre such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud

And it goes
I want to be your dominated love slave
I want to be the one that takes the pain
You can spank me when I do not behave
Smack me in the forehead with a chain

Cause I love feelin dirty
And I love feelin cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive them staples deep

I want you to slap me and call me naughty
Put a beltsander against my skin
I want to feel pain all over my body
Cant wait to be punished for my sins

Cause I love feelin dirty
And I love feelin cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive them staples deep

Yeehah

Cause I love feelin dirty
And I love feelin cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drrrriiiveeeeStaples

Here we go again infatuation touches me just when I
Thought that it would end oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but 
Im not sure exactly what youre thinking

I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that its not different at all
I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
Thats when I say What the hey

Would I last forever You and I together hand and hand
We run away far away
Im in for nasty weather
But Ill take whatever you can
Give that comes my way far away



Going to Pasalacqua

Here we go again infatuation touches me just when I
Thought that it would end 
Oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but Im not sure exactly what youre thinking

I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that its not different at all
I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
Thats when I say What the hey

Would I last forever 
You and I together hand and hand
We run away far away
Im in for nasty weather

Hey little kid
Did you wake up late one day and
Youre not so young but youre still dumb
And youre numb to your old glory but now its gone

I fell in love but it didnt catch your fall
Then I crashed into a wall
Then I fell to pieces on the floor
Now youre sick to death

Bombs away here goes nothing
The shoutings over
Hey XKid bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shoutings over and out
Over and out again

I once was old enough
To know better man I was too young to care
Many cares probably would but 
Harvey Wood is dead and gone

You fell in love but then you just fell apart
Like a kick in the head
Youre an XKid and you never even got started again

Bombs away here goes nothing
The shoutings over
Hey XKid bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shoutings over and out
Over and out

And you were such a young soul
And you got lost and out of control
You went over the edge of joking
And I have a broken heart

Hey little kid
Did you wake up late one day and
Youre not so young but youre still dumb
Youre an XKid and you never even got started again

Bombs away here goes nothing
The shoutings over
Hey XKid bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shoutings over 
Hey XKid bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shoutings over
Hey XKid bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shoutings over and out
Over and out
Over and over and out


Sittin on the hood of a camaro
Watchin shooting stars across the earth
Counting all the bites from the mosquitoes
There goes my Minnesota girl

Lazy days
Gone without notice
In a daze with faraway eyes

Driving to a closed spot Wednesday afternoon
There goes my Minnesota girl

In a daze
Go without notice
Lazy dayswith faraway eyes

Countin from the pieces we have been through
Here comes my Minnesota girl
There goes my Minnesota girl
Theres a trouble in the air
A rumble in the streets
A going out of business sale
And a race to bankruptcy

Its not one to its to one
A common cause and a call to arms
For the health of our daughters and our sons

Its revolutions tonight x

Theres a rat in the company
A bill on easy street
How the fuck did the working stiff
Become so obsolete

Hit the lights and bang your drum
And let your flag unfold
Cause history will prove itself
In the hall of justice and lost souls

Its revolutions tonight x

We live in troubled times
From the ghettos to an empty suburban home
We live in troubled times
And Im percent sure that somethings wrong

Its revolutions tonight x
Who the hell are you to tell me what I am
 And whats my master plan
 What makes you think that it includes you 
 Selfrighteous wealth
 Stop flattering yourself

So when the smoke clears here I am
 Your reject allamerican
 Sucking up you social sect
 Making you a nervous wreck
 To hell and back and hell again Ive gone
 Youre not my type not my type

Whats the difference between you and me 
 I do what I want and you do what youre told
 So listen up and shut the hell up
 It aint no big deal
 And Ill see you in hell

So when the smoke clears here I am
 Your reject allamerican
 Sucking up you social sect
 Making you a nervous wreck
 To hell and back and hell again Ive gone
 Youre not my type not my type

So when the smoke clears here I am
 Your reject allamerican
 Falling from grace right on my face
 To hell and back and hell again Ive gone


Clenching my teeth tight 
My head is like a sponge 
Give it to me free

I wanna get ripped off 
And drown in the airwaves 
Another fatal wreck 
On the information highway

So go ahead and kill yourselves 
It all amuses me 
For Ill be damned to spend my life in hell 
Another wise ingrate

Bring me blood and pain 
Of a strangers fate 
Give it all away

Give it to me now

Im desensitized 
I wanna watch the bomb 
Blow the masses high

I wanna get ripped off 
And drown in the airwaves 
Another fatal wreck 
On the information highway

So go ahead and kill yourselves 
It all amuses me 
For Ill be damned to spend my life in hell 
Another wise ingrate

Bring me blood and pain 
Of a strangers fate 
Give it all away

I wanna get ripped off 
And drown in the airwaves 
Another fatal wreck 
On the information highway

So go ahead and kill yourselves 
It all amuses me 
For Ill be damned to spend my life in hell 
Another wise ingrate



Starry nights city lights
Coming down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers
In my head
Are we we are are we we are the waiting unknown
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
Lost and found city bound in my dreams

And screaming
Are we we are are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are are we we are the waiting

Forget me nots second thoughts
Live in isolation
Heads or tails and fairytales in my mind
Are we we are are we we are the waiting unknown
The rage and love the story of my life
The Jesus of suburbia is a lie

And screaming
Are we we are are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are are we we are the waitingunknown
Are we we are are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are are we we are the waitingunknown
Are we we are are we we are the waitingunknown


Maybe Ill see you tonight
Maybe Ill see you tonight
Wherever the night takes
Maybe youll see me too

The colder it gets
You wont see me anymore
But theres still a chance
I might walk to your door

Maybe the timings not right
I wont be seeing you tonight

Maybe Ill see you tonight
Maybe Ill see you tonight
Desperate
But not hopeless
I feel so useless
In the murder city
Desperate
But not helpless
The clock strickes midnight
In the murder city

Im wide awake
After the riot
This demonstration
Of our anguish
This empty laughter
Has no reason
Like a bottle
Of your favorite poison

We are the last call
And were so pathetic

Christians crying
In the bathroom
And i just want to
Bum a cigarette
Weve come so far
weve been so wasted
Its written
All over our faces


Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now what does this mean
Are these problems just in my mind
Things are easy when youre a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length Ive gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair

Look at my friends and see what theyve done
Ask myself why theyve had to change
I like them better when they were young
Now all these times are rearranged
I look down and stand there and cry
Nothing ever will be the same
The sun is rising now I ask why
The clouds now fall and here comes the rain

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair

Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now what does this mean
Are these problems just in my mind
Things are easy when youre a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length Ive gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair
Shes a rebel
Shes a saint
Shes assault of the earth
And shes dangerous
Shes a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction
From Chicago to Toronto
Shes the one that they
Call ol whatsername
Shes the symbol
Of resistance
And shes holding on my
Heart like a hand grenade
Is she dreaming
What Im thinking
Is she the mother of all bombs
Gonna detonate
Is she trouble
Like Im trouble
Make it a double
Twist of fate
Or a melody that

She sings of revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just cant define
Well nothing comes to mind

She sings of revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just cant define
Well nothing comes to mind

Shes a rebel
Shes a saint
Shes assault of the earth
And shes dangerous
Shes a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction 

Shes a rebel
Shes a saint
Shes assault of the earth
And shes dangerous
Shes a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction

Shes a rebel
Shes a rebel
Shes a rebel
And shes dangerous

Shes a rebel
Shes a rebel
Shes a rebel
And shes dangerous


This time 
Ive gotta put my guard down 
And pick myself up off the ground 
And take the pain 

Itll pass 
The swelling never really lasts 
But the scar remains remind me 
That Im still living 

Well its not too late 
Girl its really not worth the fight 
No ones right 
Well its time to walk away 

Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 

Well the bigger that you call 
All the lying I cant afford 

Walk away 
Walk away 

Did you win 
Oh baby did you lose 
Now youre gonna lick your wounds anyway 
But it comes back to you 

When you fall 
Youre gonna need a parachute 
Only a spare of shoes to go 
And walk away 

Well its not too late 
Girl its really not worth the fight 
No ones right 
Well its time to walk away 

Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 

Well the bigger that you call 
All the lying I cant afford 

Walk away 
Walk away 

Walk away 

Eh eh eh eh eh 
Walk away 

Eh eh eh eh eh 
Walk away 

Well the bigger that you call 
All the lying I cant afford 

Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 
Walk away 

Walk away
Hey Gloria 
Are you standing close to the edge 
Lookout to the setting sun 
The brink of your vision 
Eternal youth is a landscape of the lies 

The cracks of my skin can prove 
As the years can testify 
Say your prayers and light a fire were going to start a war 
Your slogans a gun for hire 
Its what we waited for 

Hey Gloria 
This is why we were on the edge 
The fight of our lives been drawn to this undying love 

Gloria Viva La Gloria 
You blast your name in graffiti on the walls ooohhh 
Falling through broken glass thats slashing through your spirit 
I can hear it like a jilted crowd 

Gloria Where are you Gloria 
You found a home in all your scars and ammunition 
You made your bed in salad days amongst the ruins 
Ashes to ashes of our youth 

She smashed her knuckles into winter Gloria 
As autumns wind fades into black 
She is the saint of all the sinners Gloria 
The one thats fallen through the cracks 
So dont put away your burning light 

Gloria Where are you Gloria 
Dont lose you faith to your lost naivete 
Weather the storm and dont look back on last November 
When your banners were burning down 

Gloria Viva La Gloria 
Send me your amnesty down to the broken hearted 
Bring us the season that we always will remember 
Dont let the bonfires go out 

So Gloria 
Send out your message of the light that shadows in the night 
Gloria wheres your undying love 
Tell me the story of your life 
Your life 


My mental stability reaches its bitter end
And all my senses are coming unglued
Is there any cure for this disease someone called love
Not as long as there are girls like you

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I wanna hurt myself

If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall

Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone
And lock myself up in a padded room
Id sit and spew my guts out to the open air
No one wants to hear a drunken fool

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just cant trust myself

If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall

I do not mind if this goes on
Cause now it seems Im too far gone
I must admit I enjoy myself
 please keep taking me away

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just cant trust myself

If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall
Today is the first day of the rest
Of our lives
Tomorrow is too late to pretend
Everythings all right
Im not getting any younger as long
As you dont get any older
Im not going to state that yesterday never was

Bloodshot deadbeat and a lack of sleep
Making your mascara bleed
Tears down your face
Leaving traces of my mistakes

If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night
If you live with me Ill die for you
And this compromise

I hereby solemnly to tell
The whole truth
And nothing but the truth is what
Ill ever hear from you
Trust is a dirty word that comes
Only from such a liar
But respect is something I will earn
If you have faith


Mom and Dad dont look so hot these days 
Theyre getting over the hill 
Death is closing in and catching up 
As far as I can tell 
Got a plan of action and cold blood 
And it smells of defiance 
Ill just wait for Mom and Dad to die 
And get my inheritance 

Now I want more 
Cause Im getting bored 
And Im going nowhere fast 

I was once filled with doubt 
Now its all figured out 
Nothing good can last 
Crows feet and rot are setting in 

And time is running out 
My parents income interest rate 
Is gaining higher clout Im a snot nosed slob 
Without a job 
And I know I damn Well should 

Mom and dad dont look so hot these days 
But my futures looking good


Gonna build it up just to burn it down
Youre a princess Im a fucking clown
Stop the presses cause Im killing time
Wont you be my bloody valentine

Youre just a fucking kid
And no one ever gives you a break
You want a seorita
And now your heart is gonna break

Youre angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Now Im singing out the alphabet
As the tears are putting out my cigarette

Were at the cemetary so we can see the holiday lights
Waking up the dead and everythingll be alright

Youre angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces

Alright
Stuck in the middle of Heaven and Hell
Alright
Trying to find my better angels

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Stop the presses cause Im killing time
Wont you be my bloody valentine

Youre just a fucking kid
And no one ever gives you a break
You want a seorita
And now your heart is gonna break

Youre angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces

I havent got much time so Ill get to the point
You wanna share a ride 
And get the fuck out of this joint
I got an impulse so impulsive that it burns
I wanna break your heart 
Until it makes your stomach churn

I gotta know if youre the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be

So stay stay the night
Cuz were runnin out of time
So stay the night
I dont wanna say goodbye
Stay stay the night
Cuz were runnin out of time
so stay the night
I dont want to say goodbye

Im just sick and tired of feeling so alone
Well I dont understand the point if you have to go home
Why wont you stay and cure the circles round my eyes
And we can watch the stars until the sun begins to rise

I gotta know if youre the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be

So stay stay the night
Cuz were runnin out of time
So stay the night
I dont wanna say goodbye
Stay stay the night
Cuz were runnin out of time
so stay the night
I dont want to say goodbye
Come with me and lets go for a ride
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout

Cause I know that youre the
Best thing in town best thing around
Best thing in town best thing around

Running wild and always running free
Exploring things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds

Now I know that youre the
Best thing in town best thing around
Best thing in town best thing around

Im seeing faces
Of mysteries of the earth
I am not one
To the aggressions of my birth
Or go to stance
Of hallucinations I cant find
A missing piece
Of a thought thats in my mind

Come with me and lets go for a ride
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout

Cause I know that youre the
Best thing in town best thing around
Best thing in town best thing around

Running wild and always running free
Exploring things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds

Now I know that youre the
Best thing in town best thing around
Best thing in town best thing around
A small cloud has fallen 
The white mist hits the ground 
My lungs comfort me with joy 
Vegging on one detail 
The rest just crowds around 
My eyes itch of burning red 

Pictures sounds 
Of moving insects so surreal 
Lay around 
Looks like I found something new 

Laying in my bed 
I think Im in left field 
I picture someone I think its you 
Youre standing so damn close 
My body begins to swell 
Why does one and one make two

Pictures sounds 
Of moving insects so surreal 
Lay around 
Looks like I found something new 

Laying in my bed 
I think Im in left field 
I picture someone I think its you 
Youre standing so damn close 
My body begins to swell 
Why does one and one make two

Pictures sounds 
Of moving insects so surreal 
Lay around 
Looks like I found something new
Lights out
Here comes the night
As the darkness falls over the light
Lights out
There goes the day
And this fear that comes wont go away

And Im losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And Im living out my private suicide 
lights out

Lights out
I lost myself
In the space between heaven and hell
Lights out
Finding my way
Did I waste my time losing the way

And Im losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And Im living out my private suicide 
lights out

Lights out

Lights out
Here comes the night
As the darkness falls over the light
Lights out
I lost myself
In the space between heaven and hell

Well Im losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And Im living out my private suicide 
lights out
Yeah Yeah Yeah

And the brokenhearted
The season of misery

The rejects and waste of times

We sold our souls and so ashamed of ourselves
So we wait for miss judgment day
Write me a letter and send it to my grave

All fucked up beyond intervention
Fuck the world
This is my revolution
Long lost souls and livin in cages
Im on a bender
Its one for the ages

Ive got the urge 
To binge and surge
The tables turn
To crash and burn

Juliana Homicide
Make my demons come to life
Juliana Homicide
Oh Wont you be my blushing bride

Chop me a line
Of my best friends ashes
Dust to dust
When the red Light flashes
What the fuck does ok stand for
When the afterlife is nothing worth dying for

I got the urge 
To binge and surge
The tables turn
To crash and burn

Juliana Homicide
Make my demons come to life
Juliana Homicide
Oh Wont you be my blushing bride
Alright

Well Californias burning to the ground
And Juliana walks on holy ground
Where theres smoke theres fire
Burning out the lights
Cause Californias burning down tonight
Tonight

Calling all demons
This is the season
Next stop is therapy

Were the retarded 
And the brokenhearted
The season of misery

Heres to the wasted

The rejects and waste of times

Hey can you hear me
Im calling your name
Hello Or is this goodbye
The gleam in your eyes
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again
So I can rest my head

Angel Angel Dancing away
As all of my thoughts get rearranged
Angel Angel Turning away
Just when thing seem
To have changed
So I can rest my head

Hey can you hear me
Im calling your name
Hello Or is this goodbye
The gleam in your eyes
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again
So I can rest my head

Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love

Violence on the rise
Like a bullet in the sky
Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
Kindred Spirits sing
For the sick and suffering
The city of damage control
This is how we

Roll Roll

Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the ones in control

Teach our children well
From the bottom of the well
Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
Hear the children sing
For the sick and suffering
The city of damage control
This is how we

Roll Roll Roll

Violence on the rise
Like a bullet in the sky
Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
Kindred Spirits sing
For the sick and suffering

Sitting in my room last night
Staring at the mirror
I couldnt find a reason why
I couldnt be near her

Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night Im thinking
About the words youd say

Pictures going through my mind
When were together
All these long and sleepless nights
Will I ever get better

Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night Im thinking
About the words youd say
Cause you are the one I want

Now you know how I feel
This love is forever
You make my life seem so unreal
Will I ever get better 

Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night Im thinking
About the words youd say
Cause you are the one I want
I crossed the river
Fell into the sea
Where the nonbelievers go beyond belief
Then I scratched the surface
In the mouth of hell
Running out of service in the blood I fell

Well I I just want to see the light
And I I dont want to lose my sight
Well I I just want to see the light
And I need to know whats worth the fight

Ive been wasted
Pills and alcohol
Ive been chasing
Down the pool halls
I drank the water from a hurricane
I set a fire just to see the flame

Well I I just want to see the light
And I I dont want to lose my sight
Well I I just want to see the light
And I need to know whats worth the fight

I crossed the desert
Reaching higher ground
Then I found the pavement to take the liars down
But its gone forever but never too late
Where the ever after is in the hands of fate

Well I I just want to see the light
And I I dont want to lose my sight
Well I I just want to see the light
And I need to know whats worth the fight
 Billy Joe its certainly has exciting to meet you here in the recording studio right after you just made your very first record How does it feel
 Mmm Wonderful

She smashed the radio 
With the board of education 
Turn up the static left 
Of the state of the nation 

Turn up the flame step on the gas 
Burning the flag at half mast 
Shes a rebels forgotten son 
An export of the revolution 

She is the first voice 
Of the last ones in the line 
Shell drag the lake 
To keep the vendetta alive 

Bring in the head of the government 
The dog ate the document 
Somebody shot the President 
And no one knows where Maria went 

Maria Maria Maria 
Where did you go 

Be careful what youre offering 
Your breath lacks the conviction 
Drawing the line in the dirt 
Because the last decision is no is no

She smashed the radio 
With the board of education 
Turn up the static left

Maria Maria Maria 
Where did you go 

Maria Maria Maria 
Where did you go



Im having trouble trying to sleep 
Im counting sheep but running out 
As time ticks by 
And still I try 
No rest for cross tops in my mind 
On my own here we go 

My eyes feel like theyre going to bleed 
Dried up and bulging out my skull 
My mouth is dry 
My face is numb 
Fucked up and spun out in my room 

On my own here we go 
My mind is set on overdrive 
The clock is laughing in my face 
A crooked spine 
My sense dulled 
Passed the point of delirium 
On my own here we go


Hey there lookin at me
Tell me what do you see
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Dont have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit grey

Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon
I just need a little time

What is it that drives me mad
Girls like you that I never had
What is it about you that I adore
What makes me feel so much pain
That makes me go so insane
What is it about you that I adore

Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon
I just need a little time

Why did you have to leave so soon
Why did you have to walk away
Oh well it happened again
She walked away with her boyfriend
Maybe well meet again someday


Dont wanna be an American idiot
Dont want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria
The subliminal mind fuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation

Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along in the age of paranoia

I lock myself inside my room
I wanna be alone
With you around youll only add on
I wanna be alone
Its been disturbed by my thoughts

Staring out of my window
Watching the cars go rolling by
My friends are gone
Ive got nothing to do
So I sit here patiently
Watching the clock tick so slowly
Gotta get away
Or my brains will explode

Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

See the hills from afar
Standing on my beat up car
The sun went down and the night fills the sky
Now I feel like me once again
As the train comes rolling in
Smoked my boredom gone
Slapped my brains up so high

Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
Well always seem to find our way to Christie Road

Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
Well always seem to find our way to Christie Road

If theres one thing that I need
That makes me feel complete
So I go to Christie Road
Its home

Take away the sensation inside
 Bitter sweet migraine in my head
 Its like a throbbing tooth ache of the mind
 I cant take this feeling anymore

x
Drain the pressure from the swelling
 This sensations overwhelming
 Give me a long kiss goodnight
 And everything will be alright
 Tell me that I wont feel a thing
 So give me Novacaine

Out of body and out of mind
 Kiss the demons out of my dreams
 I get the funny feeling thats alright
 Jimmy says its better than air
 Ill tell you why

Drain the pressure from the swelling
 This sensations overwhelming
 Give me a long kiss goodnight
 And everything will be alright
 Tell me that I wont feel a thing
 So give me Novacaine

 Oh Novacaine

Drain the pressure from the swelling
 This sensations overwhelming
 Give me a long kiss goodnight
 And everything will be alright
 Tell me Jimmy I wont feel a thing
 So give me Novacaine


My friend drove off the other day 
And now hes gone and all they say 
Is you gotta live cause life goes on 
But now I see Im mortal too 
I cant live my life like you 
Gotta live it up while life goes on 

And I think its alright 
That I do what I like 
Cause thats the way I wanna live 
And so I give and Im still giving 

And now I wonder about my friend 
If he gave all he could give 
Cause he lived his life like I live mine 
If you could see inside my head 
Then youd start to understand 
The things I value in my heart 

You know that 
I know that 
Youre watching me

Gotta make a plan
Gotta do whats right
Cant run around in circles if you wanna build a life
And I dont wanna make a plan for a day far away
While Im young and while Im able all I wanna do is
Were living in repetition
Content in the same old shtick again
Now the routines turning to contention
Like a production line going over and over and over 
Roller coaster

Now I cannot speak I lost my voice
Im speechless and redundant
Cause I love yous not enough
Im lost for words

Choreographed and lack of passion
Prototypes of what we were
Went full circle til Im nauseous
Taken for granted now
Now I waste it I faked it 
I ate it now I hate it

Cause I cannot speak I lost my voice
Im speechless and redundant
Cause I love yous not enough
Im lost for words now I cannot speak

Now I cannot speak I lost my voice
Im speechless and redundant
Cause I love yous not enough
Im lost for words


Im on a sentimental journey
Into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the
War thats in my mind
While leaving in the lurch and Im
Taking back whats mine

Im on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
Into desolation road
Where Im a

Castaway going at it alone
Castaway now Im on my own
Castaway going at it alone
Castaway now Im on my own
Lost and found trouble bound
Castaway

Im riding on the night train and
Driving stolen cars
Testing my nerves out of the boulevard
Spontaneous combustion in the
Corners of my mind
While leaving in the lurch
And Im taking back whats mine

Im on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
Into desolation road
Where Im a

Castaway going at it alone
Castaway now Im on my own
Castaway going at it alone
Castaway now Im on my own
Lost and found trouble bound
Castaway

Im on a sentimental journey
Into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the
War thats in my mind
While leaving in the lurch and Im
Taking back whats mine

Im on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
Into desolation road
Where Im a

Castaway going at it alone

Thought I ran into you down on the street
 Then it turned out to only be a dream
 I made a point to burn all of her photographs
 She went away and then I took a different path
 I remember the face
 But I cant recall the name
 Now I wonder how Whatsername has been

Seems that she disappeared without a trace
 Did she ever marry ol Whatshisface 
 I made a point to burn all of the photographs
 She went away and then I took a different path
 I remember the face
 But I cant recall the name
 Now I wonder how Whatsername has been 

Remember whatever
 It seems like forever ago
 Remember whatever
 It seems like forever ago

The regrets are useless in my mind
 Shes in my head
 I must confess
 The regrets are useless in my mind
 Shes in my head
 From so long ago
 Go go go

And in the darkest night
 If my memory serves me right
 Ill never turn back time
 Forgetting you but not the time


Say hello from your window 
Say goodbye from your car 
Say goodnight from your pillow 
Say so long from the stars

Stay out of my out of my life
Sing to me a lullaby
Cradle songs from a new life
Dont forget to pass me by

My imagination runs away
On this th avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the Whispering Wall
Before all the flames burn out

My imagination runs away
On this th avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the Whispering Wall
Before all the flames burn out



Verse 
Life after youth
Faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love
First forgiveness
We were delinqunts
Freaks of a faded memory

Chorus
Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
Were outlaws of redemption baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
Were outlaws of forever baby

Verse 
Scars broken hearts
Breaking in cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls
Bottle rockets
All that we wanted
Its for our lives beyond stars

Chorus
Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
Were outlaws of redemption baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
Were outlaws of forever baby

Bridge
Ive got no supervision
Nothing will change my spirits
Race around with my innocence
Ill plead my innocence
But thats my best defense
When you are young

Chorus
Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
Were outlaws of redemption baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
Were outlaws all forever

Outro
I found a knife by the railroad track
You took a train and you cant go back
Forever now forever now youll roam roam roam roam



Well Ive got a fever
A nonbeliever
Im in a state of grace
For I am the Caesar
Peacemaker
Im gonna seize the day
Well call of the banshee hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
As God as my witness 
The infidels are gonna pay

Well call the assassin
The orgasm
A spasm of love and hate
For what will divide us
The righteous and the meek
Well call of the wild hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
Death to the girl at the end of the serenade

Vendetta sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire 
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite

I am a killjoy from Detroit
I drink from a well of rage
I feed off the weakness with all my love
Call up the captain hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
Death to the lover that you were dreaming of

This is a stand off
A Molotov cocktail
On the house
You thought I was a write off
You better think again
Call the peacemaker hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
Im gonna send you back to the place where it all began

Vendetta sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite

Well now the caretakers the undertaker
Now Im gonna go out and get the peacemaker
This is the neo St Valentines Massacre
Well call up the Gaza hey hey
hey hey hey hey hey
Death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well death to the ones at the end of the serenade


Ill go for miles
 Till I find you
 You say you want to leave me
 But you cant choose
 Ive gone through pain
 Every day and night
 I feel my mind is going insane
 Something I cant fight

Dont leave me x

A blank expression
 Covering your face
 Im looking for directions
 For out of this place
 I start to wonder
 If youll come back
 I feel the rain storming after thunder
 I cant hold back

Dont leave me x

Ill go for miles
 Till I find you
 You say you want to leave me
 But you cant choose
 Ive gone through pain
 Every day and night
 I feel my mind is going insane
 Something I cant fight

Dont leave me x


See a young girl so soft and blonde
 Doesnt attack me but she did once
 Intoxications in her veins
 Sweet young boy plays with her brain

Lydiall bring to life
 What are your chance not to oblige
 Putting his hand on her thigh
 Ability has now been ripped
 Take it away Id rather sit

Sweet children
 Sweet children
 Sweet children
 Remember when

Johnnys playing fun and games
 Or else hes in the storage shed
 Running from the light of day
 Or maybe lie and celebrate

The funny circus from his head
 Follow me if you understand
 Ill trick her so shell do it
 Then Ill sing and now we run

Sweet children
 Sweet children
 Sweet children
 Remember when

Sweet children
 Sweet children
 Sweet children
 Remember when

Old story 
Same old story 
Wont you see the lights of day

Talk my way out of control 
Talk myself out of falling in love 
Falling in love with you

What brings you around 
Did you lose something the last time you were here 
Youll never find it now 

Its buried deep with your identity 
so stand aside and let the next one pass 
Dont let the door kick you in the ass 

Theres no return from 
Dont even try 

Exit out the back 
And never show your head around again 
Purchase your ticket and 
Quickly take the last train 
Out of town

As I stepped to the edge
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
With my conscience beating
Like the pulse of a drum
That hammers on and on
Until I reach the break of day
As the sun beats down on
The halfway house
Has my conscience beating
The sound in my ear
The will to persevere
As I reach the break of day

Chorus
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskated and the losers
Nothings left to cling onto
Gotta to hold on
You got to hold on to yourself

A cry of hope
A plea for peace
And my conscience beating
Its not what I want for
Its all that I need
To reach the break of day
So I run to the edge
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
With my conscience bleeding
Here lies the truth the lost treasures of my youth
As I hold on to the break of day

Chorus
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskated and the losers
Nothings left to cling on
Gotta to hold on 
Hold on to yourself

Take it up

instrumental break

Chorus
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskated and the losers
Nothings left to cling on
You got to hold on
Gotta to hold on
Hold on hold on to yourself 


Breaking in a sweat
 Like a bomb threat
 Is your silhouette fading out
 Nothing left to lose
 Detonate the fuse
 Another breaking news blowout

Aint it beautiful
 So unusual
 Lifes a gas and its running out
 Living a cliche
 Gonna seize the day
 Bottle rockets and celebrate celebrate celebrate

Carpe diem a battle cry
 Are we all too young to die
 Ask a reason and no reply
 Are we all too young to die

Making a living
 Making a killing
 Whats worth forgiving
 Alright

The blink of an eye
 Barely scraping by
 Dominated by passer bys
 Feeling out of luck
 When the traffics stuck
 And youre feeling
 So left behind

Getting off a binge
 Get a second wind
 Another promise
 Just make a change
 Got a Broken wing
 Hear the angels sing
 With a signal thats out of range
 Aint it strange
 Aint it strange

Carpe diem a battle cry
 Are we all too young to die
 Ask a reason and no reply
 Are we all too young to die

Making a living
 Making a killing
 Whats worth forgiving
 Alright

Im all busted up
Broken bones and nasty cuts
Accidents will happen
But this time I cant get up
She comes to check on me
Making sure Im on my knees
After all shes the one
Who put me in this state

Is she ultraviolent
Is she disturbed
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh god shes killing me

For now Ill lie around
hell thats all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true

Is she ultraviolent
Is she disturbed
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh god shes killing me

Looking out my window for
Someone thats passing by
No one knows Im locked in here
All I do is cry

For now Ill lie around
hell thats all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true
I fucked up again its all my fault 
So turn me around and face the wall 
Read me my rights and tell me Im wrong
Until it gets into my thick skull 

A slap on the wrist a stab in the back 
Torture me Ive been a bad boy 
Nail me to the cross until you have won 
I lost before I did any wrong 

Im hexed with regrets and bad luck 
Keep you distance cause its rubbing off 
Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell 
Or earth with me tangled at your feet 
You finally met your nemesis
Disguised as your fatal long lost love 
So kiss it good bye 
Until death do we part 
You fell for a jinx for crying out loud

Im a curse hanging around you x
Now you see me now you dont
Dont ask me where Im at
Cause Im a million miles away
Treated like a forbidden heel
Dont say my thoughts are not for real
Or you wont see me again

Am I here or am I there
Or am I playing on the stairs
Am I in my room with my toys
I am the disappearing boy

When I walk in crowded rooms
I feel as if it is my doom
I know that I dont belong
In that room I see her
I see her and shes with him
I turn and then Im gone

Dont call me up cause Im not home
My whereabouts are now unknown
I vanished from all your joy
Im the disappearing boy

I have my doubts
Of where I belong
Its something to think about

Dont call me up cause Im not home
My whereabouts are now unknown
I vanished from all your joy
Im the disappearing boy
Todays the Macys Day Parade
 The night of the living dead is on its way
 With a credit report for duty call
 Its a lifetime guarantee
 Stuffed in a coffin % more free
 Red light special at the mausoleum

Give me something that I need
 Satisfaction guaranteed to you
 Whats the consolation prize
 Economy sized dreams of hope

When I was a kid I thought
 I wanted all the things that I havent got
 Oh I learned the hardest way
 Then I realized what it took
 To tell the difference between
 Thieves and crooks
 A lesson learned to me and you

Give me something that I need
 Satisfaction guaranteed
 Because Im thinking about
 A brand new hope
 The one Ive never known
 Cause now I know
 Its all that I wanted

Whats the consolation prize
 Economy sized dreams of hope
 Give me something that I need
 Satisfaction guaranteed
 Because Im thinking about
 A brand new hope
 The one Ive never known
 And where it goes
 And Im thinking about
 The only road
 The one Ive never known
 And where it goes

And Im thinking about
 A brand new hope
 The one Ive never known
 Cause now I know
 Its all that I wanted






Words get trapped in my mind
Sorry I dont take the time to feel the way I do
Cause the first day you came into my life
When time ticks around you

But then I need your voice
As a key to unlock all the love
Thats trapped in me
So tell me when its time
To say I love you

All I want is you to understand
That when I take your hand
Its cause I want to
We are all born in a world of doubt
But theres no doubt
Ive figured out I love you

And Ive been alone before
All the losers that will never take the time to say
Whats really on their mind
Instead they just hide away
And yet theyll never have
Someone like you to grab their hand

And help along the way
Or tell them when its time
To say I love you
So tell me when its time
To say I love you
Somethings on my mind
Its been for quite some time
This time Im on to you
So wheres the other face

Your head trips boring me

 times before
This time well blast it all to hell
Ive had this burning in my guts now for so long
My bellys aching now to say

Stuck down in a rut of dislogic and smut
A side of you well hid
When its all said and done
its real and its been fun
But was it all REAL fun

Lets nuke the bridge we torched
 times before
This time well blast it all to hell
Ive felt this burning in my guts now for so long
My bellys aching now to say to say

Youre just a fuck
I cant explain it cause I think you suck

Verse 
Im running late to somewhere now I dont want to be
Where the future and promises aint what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side ever get so dull

Chorus 
All grown up and medicated
Im high on cellular waves
I put the riot in patriot
And we all die in threes

Verse 
I got a scene in the middle of the road
Im gonna take my time
I shop online so I can bolt
At the speed of life
Im like a drone way up in the sky
Im a shooting star
Theres a soldier thats freaking out
PS this is war

Chorus 
All grown up and medicated
Im high on cellular waves
I put the riot in patriot
And we all die in threes
All we want is money and guns
A new catastrophe
Here goes nothing theres nothing to lose
Its a small price we pay
When we all die in threes

Bridge x
Somewhere now

Outro
Hallelujah I found my soul
Under the sofa pillows
Congratulations I found myself
Somewhere now x




What good is love and peace on earth 
When its exclusive 
Wheres the truth in the written word 
If no one reads it 
A new day dawning 
Comes without warning 
So dont blink twice 

We live in troubled times 
We live in troubled times 

What part of history we learned 
When its repeated 
Some things will never overcome 
If we dont seek it 
The world stops turning 
Paradise burning 
So dont think twice 

We live in troubled times 
We live in troubled times 
We live in troubled times 

We run for cover 
Like a skyscrapers falling down 
Then I wander like a troubled mind 

What good is love and peace on earth 
When its exclusive 
Wheres the truth in the written word 
If no one reads it 
A new day dawning 
Comes without warning 
So dont look twice 

We live in troubled times x
Wherever you go
You know Ill be there
If you go far
You know Ill be there
Ill go anywhere
So Ill see you there
You place the name
You know Ill be there
You name the time
You know Ill be there
Ill go anywhere
So Ill see you there

I dont care if you dont mind
Ill be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
Ill be there for you

Where theres truth
You know Ill be there
Amongst the lies
You know Ill be there
Ill go anywhere
So Ill see you there

I dont care if you dont mind
Ill be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
Ill be there for you

If you should fall
You know Ill be there
To catch the call
You know Ill be there
Ill go anywhere
So Ill see you there

I dont care if you dont mind
Ill be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
I dont care
Ill be there for you
Ill be there for you
Verse 
Concrete dream
Im gonna make a scene
Radio
Covered in gasoline
Sleeping in reverse 
And everybodys bouncing off the walls

Verse 
Bombs away
Its just another day
Of idle threats
The secret alphabet
And I wouldnt sweat it
And everybodys bouncing off the walls
Im bouncing off the walls

Alright

Verse 
Concrete kiss
Come on and do the twist
The Radio my little exorcist
Were all getting pissed
And everybodys bouncing off the walls

x
Cause its all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
Cause were all bloody freaks
And well give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeros




He hit the ground running
At the speed of light
The star was brightly shining
Like a neon light

Its your favorite son
Its your favorite son

A fixture on the talkshows
To the silver screen
From here to Colorado
Hes a sex machine

Its your favorite son
Its your favorite son

But isnt it a drag
Isnt it a drag
Isnt it a drag
Its pretty bloody sad
But isnt it a drag

A cleancut AllAmerican
Really aint so clean
His royal auditorium
Is a murder scene

Its your favorite son
Its your favorite son

Oh isnt it a drag
Isnt it a drag
Isnt it a drag
Its pretty bloody sad
But isnt it a drag

Well no one says its fair
Turn a teenage lush
To a millionaire

Now wheres your fuckin champion
On a bed you laid
Hes not the AllAmerican
That you thought you paid

Its your favorite son
Its your favorite son

But isnt it a drag
Hey old man in womans shoes
I wonder I he knows I think hes crazy
When he was young 
Did he have dreams of wearing womans shoes and being crazy

It makes me wonder when I grow that age
Will I be walking down the street
Begging for your spare change

Or will I ever grow that old
Will I still be around
The way I carry on Ill end up
six feet underground and waste away

When the old man was in school
Did the golden rules make him go crazy
Or did he hide away from hopes
Behind a smile and smoking dope
Its crazy

It makes me wonder when I grow that age
Will I be walking down the street
Begging for your spare change

Or will I ever grow that old
Will I still be around
The way I carry on Ill end up
six feet underground and waste away

It seems so frightning
Time passes my like lightning
Before you know it youre struck down
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around


Ive been waiting a long time 
For this moment to come 
Im destined 
For anything at all 
Downtown lights will be shining 
On me like a diamond 
Ring out under the midnight hour 
No one can touch me now 
And I cant turn my back 
Its too late ready or not at all 

Im so much closer than 
I have ever known 
Wake up 

Dawning of a new era 
Calling dont let it catch you falling 
Ready or not at all 
So close enough to taste it 
Almost I can embrace this 
Feeling on the tip of my tongue 

Im so much closer than 
I have ever known 
Wake up 
Better thank your lucky stars 

Ive been waiting a lifetime 
For this moment to come 
Im destined for anything at all 

Dumbstruck 
Colour me stupid 
Good luck 
Youre gonna need it 
Where Im going if I get there 
At all 

Wake up 
Better thank your lucky stars
Amy 
Is your heart singing out of tune 
Are your eyes just singing the blues 
Dirty records from another time 
Some blood stains on your shoes 
No one really knows about your soul 
And I barely even know your name 
Burning rhythms and posting lies 
For a bunch of fools drown in shame 
Amy dont you go 
I want you around 
Singin woah please dont go 
Do you wanna be a friend of mine 
Did you tattoo a lucky charm 
To keep you out of harms way 
Warding off all evil signs 
But it never really kept you safe 
Youre too young for the golden age 
Cause the record bins been replaced 
 gone without a trace 

And you walked away from your drink 
Is your heart singing out of tune 
Are you eyes just singing the blues 
Dirty records from another time 
Some blood stains on your shoes 
May I have this last dance 
By chance if we should meet 
Can you write me a lullaby 
So we can sing you to sleep
Verse 
Shut your mouth cause youre talking too much
And I dont give a fuck anyway
You always seem to be stepping in shit
And all you really do is complain
Hitch a ride tell em all you like
Small minds tend to think alike
Shut your mouth cause youre talking too much
And I dont give a fuck anyway

Chorus
Let yourself go let yourself go let yourself go x
Gotta let me go gotta let it go x

Verse 
Cut the crap cause youre screaming in my ear
And youre talking up all of my space
Youre thinning my patience again
And Id rather get punched in the face
Youre getting on my every last nerve
Everything youve said Ive already heard
Im sick to death of your every last breath
And I dont give a fuck anyway

Chorus
Let yourself go let yourself go let yourself go x
Gotta let me go gotta let it go x

Guitar Solo

Everyone is fucking with my head now 
Dont stop fucking with my head now
Youre fucking with my fucking head now
Youre the every thing I cant stand

Chorus
Let yourself go let yourself go let yourself go x
Gotta let me go gotta let it go x
Bring me back to an hour ago
Time stands still as the years go by
Brown eyed girl thats throwing down a bottle of Olde English
Back in the warehouse

Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
Kids alright alright as theyll ever be

Cause you will always be my
Well you will always by my
You will always be my sweet sixteen

Sleep on the floor on cardboard
Stab out my heart like a dart board
Browned skinned girl I had a dream about a long long time now
From the midwest to the beach

Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
Kids alright alright as theyll ever be

Cause you will always be my
Well you will always by my
You will always be my sweet sixteen

Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
Kids alright alright as theyll ever be

Cause you will always be my
Well you will always by my
You will always be my sweet sixteen



Hes a victim of his own time 
In his vintage suit and tie 
Hes casualty dressed to the teeth 
In the latest genocide 
The new seasons come and go 
At the dog and pony show 
Gonna sit and beg and fetch the names 
And fallow the dress codes 
Whats in a nameHEY 
Shes a scented magazine 
Looking sharp and leaving clean 
Living well and dressed to kill 
But she looks like hell to me 
So when youre dancing throgh your wardrope 
Do the anorex a gogo 
Cloaked with style for pedophiles 
As the credit card explodes 
You auctioned off your life 
For the most expensive price 
Going once 
Going twice 
Now its gone 
Whats in a name hey 
Whats in a name hey 
Say hey


Im not fucking around
I think Im coming out
All the deceivers and cheaters
Ive think weve got a bleeder right now
Want you to slap me around
Want you to knock me out
Well you missed me kissed me
Now you better kick me down

Maybe youre the runner up
But the first one to lose the race
Almost only really counts in
Horseshoes and hand grenades

Im gonna burn it all down
Im gonna rip it out
Well everything that you employ
Was meant for me to destroy
To the ground now
So dont you fuck me around
Because Ill shoot you down
Im gonna drink fight and fuck
And pushing my luck
All the time now

Maybe youre the runner up
But the first one to lose the race
Almost only really counts in
Horseshoes and hand grenades

Demolition selfdestruction
What to annihilate
The ageold contradiction
Demolition selfdestruction
What to annihilate
The old age

Im not fucking around
I think Im coming out
All the deceivers and cheaters
Ive think weve got a bleeder right now
Im not fucking around
GLORIA


She is my drama queen
 She is so wild and reckless
 She is my drama queen

She dangles from her necklace
 Daddys little bundle of joy
 Out of a magazine
 Everyones drama queen
 Is old enough to bleed now

She is my drama queen
 Her life is now unfolding
 There goes my drama queen
 What do you think shes holding

Aye little drama queen
 How did you find your savior
 Oh little drama queen
 You better call a lawyer

Daddys little bundle of joy
 Out of a magazine
 Everyones drama queen
 Is old enough to bleed now

Aye little drama queen
 From here to San Francisco
 Everyones drama queen
 I think shes going psycho

Daddys little bundle of joy
 Out of a magazine
 Everyones drama queen
 Is old enough to bleed now

Shes old enough to bleed now
 Shes old enough to bleed now

Shes a loner not a stoner
Bleeding heart and the soul of Miss Teresa
Supernova Cherry Cola
Shes the cedar in the trees of Minnesota

Im a rough boy round the edges
Getting drunk and fallen in the hedges
Shes my weakness fucking genius
Swear to god and Im not even superstitious

Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
Theyre all out without you
Having fun

Where have all the bastards gone
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collecting unemployment checks
Like a flunky along for a ride
Where have all the riots gone
As your citys model gets pulverized
Whats in love is now in debt
On your birth certificate
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse

The town bishop is an extortionist
And he dont even know that you exist
Standing still when its do or die
You better run for your fucking life

Chorus
Its not over till your underground
Its not over before its too late
Its cities burnin its not my burden
Its not over before its too late

Theres nothing left to analyze

Where will all the martyrs go
When the virus cures itself
And where will we all go
When its too late

And dont look back

Youre not the Jesus of Suburbia
The St Jimmy is a figment of
Your fathers rage and your mothers love
Made me the idiot America

Chorus

She said I cant take this place
Im leaving it behind
Well she said I cant take this town
Im leaving you tonight


Verse 
I woke up to a bitter storm bitter year
And Noahs Ark came washed up on the shore
The riot gear has lined the dawn bitter year
Like dogs that shit on your neighbors lawn

PreChorus
Let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade
Let them eat poison and it tastes like lemonade

Chorus
Back in the USA for a small town serenade
With fireworks on display
Tonight its a heros welcome home
And theres no place else to go
And Im takin it to the grave
Back in the USA

Verse 
The saddest story ever told bitter year
Is feeling safe in our suburban homes
Like soldiers of an endless war bitter year
And every church can have a liquor store

PreChorus
Let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade
Let them eat poison and it tastes like lemonade

Chorus
Back in the USA for a small town serenade
With fireworks on display
Tonight its a heros welcome home
And theres no place else to go
And Im takin it to the grave
Back in the USA
All the time
Every time I need it
Whats the time
Id say the time is right
Heres to me
Lets find another reason
Down the hatch and a bad attitude
Salut

Wastin time
Wastin time
Down a bum fuck road
And I dont know where the hell itll go
Heirlooms
Huffing fumes
And Im pickin up the pace
And Im gonna smash straight into a wall

All the time
New Years resolutions
How soon that we forget
Doin time
Lovin every minute
Live it up on another let down
Salut

Promises
Promises
It was all set in stone
Cross my heart and I hope to die
Sugar fix
Dirty tricks
And a trick question
Guess I should have read between the lines

Havin the time of my life
Watchin the clock tick
Havin the time of my life
Watchin the clock tick

All the time
Where did all the time go
Its too late to say good night
Time flies
When youre havin fun yeah
Times up when you work like a dog
Salut



Im talking all you down with me
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothings gonna change my mind
I wont listen to anyones last words
Theres nothing left for you to say
Soon youll be dead anyway

Well no one here is getting out alive
This time Ive really lost my mind and I dont care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times weve spent and what theyve been
To me its nothing
To me its nothing
To me its nothing
To me its nothing

Im losing all my happiness
The happiness you pinned on me
My loneliness still comforts me
My anger dwells inside of me
Im taking it all out on you
And all that shit you put me through

Well no one here is getting out alive
This time Ive really lost my mind and I dont care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times weve spent and what theyve been
To me its nothing
To me its nothing
To me its nothing
To me its nothing

Do you ever think back to another time
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
And mow down any bullshit that confronts you
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head
To make one problem that adds up to nothing
To me its nothing
To me its nothing
To me its nothing



Now it seems I cant keep my mind of you
My brain drifts back to better days weve been through
Like sitting on blacktop of the school grounds
The love I witched about I finally found

But now its gone and I take the blame
So theres nothing I can do but take the pain
Why

Now I dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me I am blind without a cause
And now I realized what I have lost

It was something real that I could have had
Now I play the fool whose stable souls gone bad
Why

Tell me the words I might have said
Thats pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late
Just tell me the words I might have ate

But now its gone and I take the blame
So theres nothing I can do but take the pain
Why
This whiskey sour amateur hour
Raise your glass and toast your friends
Someday we will fight again
Well your enemies your tragedies
Pocket knives and rusty chains
Where the hell is the old gang at

And all the losers cant even win for losing
And the beginners dont even know what song theyre singing

When theres no one left around
And youre the last gang in town
And your heart cant even break
When it doesnt even pound x

This broken scene is turning green
A brass knuckles left in the rain
Death wish kids among the living
I wanna ride on the divided
Anything but the mainstream
Where the fck is your old gang man

And all the losers cant even win for losing
And the beginners dont even know what song theyre singing

When theres no one left around
And youre the last gang in town
And your heart cant even break
When it doesnt even pound x

So long
Didnt even say goodnight
So long
Theres nowhere to go when youre hiding in plain sight

When theres no one left around
And youre the last gang in town
And your heart cant even break
When it doesnt even pound x

They call the Rising Sun

Until the clouds unroll and you come down The line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent your descent

   The Saints Are Coming  Skids


Ive got a really bad disease 
Its got me begging 
On my hands and knees 
So take me to the emergency 
Cause something seems to be missing 
Somebody take the pain away 
Its like an ulcer bleeding in my brain 
So send me to the pharmacy 
So I can lose my memory 

Im elated 
Medicated 
Lord knows I tried to find a way to run away 

I think they found another cure 
For broken hearts and feeling insecure 
Youd be surprised what I endure 
What make you feel so selfassured 

I need to find a place to hide 
You never know what could be 
Waiting outside 
The accidents that you could find 
Its like some kind of suicide 

So what ails you is what impales you 
I feel like Ive been crucified 
To be satisfied 

Im a victim of my symptom 
I am my own worst enemy 
Youre a victim of your symptom 
You are your own worst enemy 
Know your enemy 

Im elated 
Medicated 
I am my own worst enemy 
So what ails you is what impales you 
You are your own worst enemy 
Youre a victim of the system 
You are your own worst enemy 
Youre a victim of the system 
You are your own worst enemy

So I can lose my memory 

Im elated 
Medicated 
Lord knows I tried to find a way to run away 

I think they found another cure 
For broken hearts and feeling insecure 
Youd be surprised what I endure 
What make you feel so selfassured 

I need to find a place to hide 
You never know what could be 
Waiting outside 
The accidents that you could find 
Its like some kind of suicide 

So what ails you is what impales you 
I feel like Ive been crucified 
To be satisfied 

Im a victim of my symptom 
I am my own worst enemy 
Youre a victim of your symptom 
You are your own worst enemy 
Know your enemy 

Im elated 
Medicated 
I am my own worst enemy 
So what ails you is what impales you 
You are your own worst enemy 
Youre a victim of the system 
You are your own worst enemy 
Youre a victim of the system 
You are your own worst enemy 


I woke up in a pool of sweat
First I thought that I pissed the bed
Haunted stories in the midnight hour
The kiss of death from the Eiffel Tower

And I went down like the speed of sound
Youre out of sight but not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck 
And I fell for you

Ill spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while
Ill crash into you I crash into you
Cause you crash in my imagination too

Break a leg and you crush my heart
Im a mess and youre a work of art
Count your blessings going zero to five
Steal a kiss and I took a dive

And I went down like the speed of sound
Youre out of sight but not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips 
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck 
And I fell for you

Ill spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while
Ill crash into you I crash into you
Cause you crash in my imagination

I had a dream that I kissed your lips 
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck 
And I fell for you

And I fell for you
And I fell for you
She
 She screams in silence
 A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
 Waiting for a sign
 To smash the silence with the brick of selfcontrol

Are you locked up in a world
 Thats been planned out for you
 Are you feeling like a social tool 
 Without a use
 Scream at me until my ears bleed
 Im taking heed just for you

She
 Shes figured out
 All her doubts were someone elses point of view
 Waking up this time
 To smash the silence with the brick of selfcontrol

Are you locked up in a world
 Thats been planned out for you
 Are you feeling like a social tool 
 Without a use
 Scream at me until my ears bleed
 Im taking heed just for you

EHHHHHH aHHHHHHHHHH

Are you locked up in a world
 Thats been planned out for you
 Are you feeling like a social tool 
 Without a use
 Scream at me until my ears bleed
 Im taking heed just for you


Part I Mass Hysteria

Sing us the song of the century
That sings like American eulogy
The dawn of my love and conspiracy
Of forgotten hope and the class of 
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me

Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria

Red alert is the color of panic
Elevated to the point of static
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics
And the neighborhoods a loaded gun
Idle thought leads to fullthrottle screaming
And the welfare is asphyxiating
Mass confusion is all the new rage
And its creating a feeding ground
For the bottom feeders of hysteria

Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria

True sounds of maniacal laughter
And the deafmute is misleading the choir
The punchline is a natural disaster
And its sung by the unemployed
Fight fire with a riot
The class war is hanging on a wire
Because the martyr is a compulsive liar when he said
Its just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the hysteria

Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria

Theres a disturbance on the oceanside
They tapped into the reserve
The static response is so unclear now
Mayday this is not a test
As the neighborhood burns America is falling
Vigilantes warning you alling Christian and Gloria

Part II Modern World

I dont want to live in the modern world
I dont want to live in the modern world
I dont want to live in the modern world
I dont want to live in the modern world

Im the class of 
In the era of dissent
A hostage of the soul
On a strike to pay the rent
The last of the rebels
Without a common ground
Im gonna light a fire
Into the underground

I dont want to live in the modern world
I dont want to live in the modern world
I dont want to live in the modern world
I dont want to live in the modern world

I am a nation
Without bureaucratic ties
Deny the allegation as its written

I want to take a ride to the great divide
Beyond the up to date
And the neogentrified
The high definition for the low resident
Where the value of your mind
Is not held in contempt
I can hear the sound of
A beating heart
That bleeds beyond a system
Thats falling apart
With money to burn
On minimum wage
Cause I dont give a shit
About the modern age

I dont want to live in the modern world
I dont want to live in the modern world
I dont want to live in the modern world
I dont want to live in the modern world
I dont want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I dont want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I dont want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I dont want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria











I heard you crying loud
 All the way across town
 Youve been searching for that someone
 And its me out on the prowl
 As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
 Well dont get lonely now
 And dry your whining eyes
 Im just roaming for the moment
 Sleazin my back yard so dont get so uptight
 you been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
 Cause you know where Ill be found
 When I come around

I heard it all before
 So dont knock down my door
 Im a loser and a user so I dont need no accuser
 to try and slag me down because I know youre right
 So go do what you like
 Make sure you do it wise
 You may find out that your selfdoubt means 
 Nothing was ever there

You cant go forcing something 
 If its just not right

No time to search the world around
 Cause you know where Ill be found
 When I come around
 When I come around

No time to search the world around
 Cause you know where Ill be found
 When I come around
 When I come around
 When I come around
 When I come around


Ive got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we shared
Makes me wish that you were here
Now it seems Ive forgotten my purpose in this life
All the songs have been erased
Guess Ive learned from my mistakes

Open the past and present
Now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present
And the future too
Its all Ive got and Im giving it up to you

Loose ends tied in knots
Leaving a lump down in my throat
Gagging on a souvenir
Lodged to fill another year
Drag it on and on 
Until my skin is ripped to shreds
Leaving myself wide open
Living out a sacrifice

Open the past and present
Now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present
And the future too
Its all Ive got and Im giving it up to you

If you got no one
And Ive got no place to go
Would it be alright 
Could it be alright

Ive got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we shared
Makes me wish that you were here
Now it seems Ive forgotten my purpose in this life
All the songs have been erased
Guess Ive learned from my mistakes

Open the past and present
Now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present
And the future too
Its all Ive got and Im giving it up to you
Its all Ive got and Im giving it up to you
Little girl little girl
Why are you crying
Inside your restless soul your heart is dying
Little one little one
Your soul is purging
Of love and razor blades
Your blood is surging

Runaway
From the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
Your a stray for the salvation army
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go

Little girl little girl
Your life is calling
The charlatans and saints of your abandon
Little one little one
The sky is falling
The lifeboat of deception is now sailing
In the wake all the way
No rhyme or reason
Your bloodshot eyes
Will show your heart of treason
Little girl little girl
You dirty liar
Youre just a junkie
Preaching to the choir

Runaway
To your lost tranquility
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
Youre a stray for the dregs of humanity
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go

The traces of blood
Always follow you home
Like the mascara tears
From your getaway
Your walking with blisters
and running with shears
So unholy
Sister of grace

Runaway
From the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
Youre a stray for the salvation army
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go


Part  The death of St Jimmy
My heart is beating from me
I am standing all alone
Please call me only if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live
In the streets of shame
Where youve lost your dreams in the rain
Theres no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
Theres a glow of light
The St Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
The fixture in the city of lust
What the hells your name
Whats your pleasure and whats your pain
Do you dream to much
Do you think what you need is a crutch
In the crowd of pain St Jimmy comes without any shame
He says were fucked up
But were not the same
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame

Jimmy died today

He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind its my own private suicide

Part  East th St
Well nobody cares
Well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares

Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on east th st
Hes not listened to a word now
Hes in his own world
And hes daydreaming

Hed rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His lifes on the line with anxiety now
And she had enough
And he had plenty

Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

So far away
I dont want to stay
Get me out of here right now
I just wanna be free
Is there a possibility
Get me out of here right now
This life like dream aint for me

Part  Nobody likes you
I fell asleep while watching spike TV
After cups of coffee
And youre still not here
Dreaming of a song
But something went wrong
But I cant tell anyone
Cause no ones here
Left me here alone
And I should have stayed home
After cups of coffee Im thinking
whered you go
Nobody likes you everyone left you
whered you go
Theyre all out without you havin fun
whered you go
Everyone left you nobody likes you
whered you go
Theyre all out without you havin fun
whered you gogogogo

GeezeHa

Part  Rock and roll girlfriend
written and sung by Tre Cool
I got a rock and roll band
I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
And another exwife
I got a rock and roll house
I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums
And I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York
I got a kid in the bay
I havent drank or smoked nothin
In over days
So get off my case
Off of my case
Off of my case

Part  Were coming home again
Here they come marching down the street
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
The time has come and it going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
Gocarts and guns are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat
The world is spinning
Around and around
Out of control again
From the to the fear of breaking down
To send my love a letterbomb
And visit me in hell
Were the ones going

Home
Were coming home again
Home
Were coming home again

I started fuckin running
As soon as my feet touched the ground
Were back in the Barrio
But to you and me thats jingle town

Home
Were coming home again
Home
Were coming home again
Home
Were coming home again
Home
Were coming home again
Home
Were coming home again
Home
Were coming home again
Home
Were coming home again
Home
Were coming home again
Home
Were coming home again

Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
Theyre all out without you havin fun


Sing us a song of the century
Thats louder than bombs and eternity
The era of static and contraband
Thats leading us to the promised land
Tell us a story thats by candlelight
Waging a war and losing the fight
Theyre playing the song of the century
Of panic and promise and prosperity
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me

Song of the century

Sing us a song of the century
Thats louder than bombs and eternity
The era of static and contraband
Thats leading us to the promised land
Tell us a story thats by candlelight
Waging a war and losing the fight

Theyre playing the song of the century
Of panic and promise and prosperity
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me


I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
Ive been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
Cause shes light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so
Never let go
Cause shes light years away
Years Away

I sit outside and watch the sunrise
Lookout as far as I can
I cant see her but in the distance
I hear some laughter
We laugh together

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
Cause shes light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so
Never let go
Cause shes light years away
Years Away

I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
Ive been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
Cause shes light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so
Never let go
Cause shes light years away


A thought burst in my head
And I need to tell you
Its news that I for thought
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago
I think I just forgot
Well it hasnt been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad

Theres a boy who fogs his world and now hes getting lazy
theres no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up or hes gonna end up quitting

I shuffle though my mind 
To see if I can find
The words I left behind
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago
Oh well
Nevermind


Go go go 

The year of the rat the first of the leader 
Somebody shot the babysitter 
They say my middle name is danger 
The kind you keep away from strangers 

Im singing woahhhh 
Im out of control 
Oh baby when I see your pretty face 
I say woahhhh 
God rest your fucking soul 
Cause baby baby I was born to go 

I pulled the trigger from the shooting stars 
I am the motor in your crashing car 
I am the cherub and the arab spring 
I am the bullet in your magazine 

Im singing woahhhh 
Im out of control 
Oh baby when I see your pretty face 
I said woahhhh 
God rest your fucking soul 
Cause baby baby eyes 
Uh baby baby eyes 
Uh baby baby I was born to kill






Baby Eyes

Year of the rat last of the litter
Somebody shot the babysitter
They say my middle name is Danger
The kind to keep away from strangers

I say woah Im out of control
Oh baby when I see your pretty face
I say woah God rest your fucking soul
Cause baby baby I was born to kill

I pulled the trigger from the shooting stars
I am the motor in your crashing car
I am the cherub in the Arab spring
I am the bullet in your magazine

I say woah Im out of control
Oh baby when I see your pretty face
I say woah God rest your fucking soul
Cause baby baby eyes

Oh baby baby eyes
Oh baby baby I was born to Kill
This is definitely not the first video to surface of an execution
 of men they claimed responsibility for the executions 
Described as severely mentally disturbed 
Videos show another hostage executed by the terrorist group 
Deserve to be annihilated 

I get my kicks
And I want to start a rager
I want to dance
Like Im on the video
I got a fever 
For a violent behavior
Im sweating bullets
Like a modern Romeo

Bang bang
Give me fame
Shoot me up to entertain
I am a semi automatic 
Lonely boy
Youre dead
Im well fed
Give me death
Or give me head
Daddys little psycho
And mommys little soldier

I testify 
Like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live
And its on my radio
I got my photo bomb
I got my Vietnam
I love a lie
Just like everybody else

Bang bang
Give me fame
Shoot me up to entertain
I am a semi automatic
Lonely boy
Youre dead
Im well fed
Give me death
Or give me head
Broadcasting from my room
And playing with my toys

I want to be a celebrity martyr
The leading man 
In my own private drama
Hurrah
Hurrah
The hero of the hour
Daddys little psycho
And mommys little soldier

I want to be like
The soldiers on the screen
It my private holy war
Oh baby baby this is 
viva vendetta
For this is love
Or its world war zero

x
I want to be a celebrity martyr
The little man
In my own private drama
Hurrah
Hurrah
The hero of the hour
Daddys little psycho 
And mommys little soldier
Where can I find the city of shining light
In an ordinary world
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world

The days into years roll by
Its where that I live until I die
Ordinary world

What would you wish if you saw a shooting star
In an ordinary world
Ive walked to the end of the earth and afar
In an ordinary world

Baby I dont have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world

Where can I find the city of shining light
In an ordinary world
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world

Baby I dont have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world
Im just a mutt
And nowhere is my home
Where dignitys a land mine
In the school of lost hope
Ive panhandled for a life because
Im not afraid to beg
Hand me down your lost and founds
Of second hand regret

You better swallow your pride
Or youre gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honors gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know Im not the one
I got no pride

Sects of disconnection
And traditions of lost faith
No cultures 
Worth a stream of piss
Or a bullet in my face
To heck with unity
Separations gonna kill us all
Torn to shreds and disjointed
Before the final fall

You better swallow your pride
Or youre gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honors gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know Im not the one
I got no pride

You better swallow your pride
Or youre gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honors gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know Im not the one
I got no pride

Close your eyes and die
I got no pride
I got no pride

Dear mother
 Can you hear me whining
 Its been three whole weeks
 Since that I have left your home
 This sudden fear has left me trembling
 Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
 And Im feeling so alone

Pay attention to the cracked streets
 And the broken homes
 Some call it the slums
 Some call it nice
 I want to take you through a wasteland 
 I like to call my home
 Welcome To Paradise

A gunshot rings out at the station
 Another urchin snaps 
 And left dead on his own
 It makes me wonder why Im still here
 For some strange reason its now
 Feeling like my home
 And Im never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets
 And the broken homes
 Some call it the slums
 Some call it nice
 I want to take you through a wasteland 
 I like to call my home
 Welcome To Paradise

Dear mother
 Can you hear me laughing
 Its been six whole months 
 Since that I have left your home
 It makes me wonder why Im still here
 For some strange reason its now
 Feeling like my home
 And Im never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets 
 And the broken homes 
 Some call it slums
 Some call it nice 
 I want take you through a wasteland 
 I like to call my home 
 Welcome to paradise 
 Paradise

How do I end up in the same old place 
 Faced again with the same mistakes 
 So stubborn 
 Thinking I know what is right 
 But life proves me wrong every time 

Taking roads that lead me nowhere 
 How do I expect to get there 
 But when will I learn to just put you first 

I come to you now when I need you 
 But why do I wait to come see you 
 I always try to do this on my own 
 But I was wrong cause only with you 
 Can I move on can I move on 

When I am weak its you that makes me strong 
 And I know that youve been with me all along 
 So many times I forget to close my eyes 
 And listen to my heart 
 With you life is so easy 
 Why do I make it hard 

Oh taking roads that lead me no where 
 How do I expect to get there 
 When will I learn to just put you first 

I I come to you now when I need you 
 But why do I wait to come see you 
 I always try to do this on my own 
 But I was wrong cause only with you 
 Can I move on 

Ill get out of my own way 
 Let you have your way 
 Cause I realized Im no good on my own 
 Im there for you Ill serve for you 
 I cant live without you 

I come to you now when I need you 
 Why do I wait to come see you 
 I always try to do this on my own 
 But I was wrong I was wrong I was wrong 
 With only you only you with only you 
 Can I move on can I move on can I move on

Imma take ya to the top girl hey 
Top of the world you ready

The moment that you walk right through the door ooh

I wish that this night would never be over
Theres plenty of time to sleep when we die
So lets just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way wed never close our eyes
Our eyes
Never

I dont wanna let a minute get away
Cause we got no time to lose
None of us are promised to see tomorrow
And what we do is ours to choose

Forget about the sunrise
Stop the sleep in your eyes
I dont wanna miss a second with you
Lets stay this way forever
It only gets better
If we want it to

You Know I I wish that this night would never be over
Theres plenty of time to sleep when we die
So lets just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way wed never close our eyes
Our eyes
Never

Its so hard to think this will fade away
What goes up must come down
Why cant we just live life with no consequence
And always live in the now

Forget about the sunrise
Stop the sleep in your eyes
I dont wanna miss a second with you
Lets stay this way forever
It only gets better
If we want it to

You Know I I wish that this night would never be over
Theres plenty of time to sleep when we die
So lets just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way wed never close our eyes
Our eyes
Never
Oh I was perfect
For the circus
 If she dared me Id do it
 Love makes you stupid
 I gave it up but I guess it was not enough
 Cause she never seemed satisfied

 Oooh ooh

 I know Im not perfect
 But at the end of the day
 Who is

 Oooh ooh

 She wanted someone thats perfect
 Well okay
 But can you tell me 
 Who is

 Ooooh oooh oooh
 Ooooh oooh oooh

 She set the bar
 Just above the stars
 A rocket couldnt reach it
 But I still kept on reaching
 She watched me try
 At least a thousand times

 If she loved me shed stop me but no

 Oooh ooh

 I know Im not perfect
 But at the end of the day
 Who is

 Oooh ooh

 She wanted someone thats perfect
 Well okay
 But can you tell me 
 Who is 

 I saw something worth my future
 So wrong so wrong
 In my mind I would tell you soon
 But I guess I wasnt wrong

 Oooh ooh 

 I know Im not perfect
 But at the end of the day
 Who is

 Oooh ooh

 She wanted someone thats perfect
 Well okay
 But can you tell me 
 Who is

 Ooooh oooh Ooooh
 Ooooh oooh Ooooh

Hands over my head
Thinking what else could go wrong
Would have stayed in bed
How can the day be so long

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out 
Removed all my doubts so believe

That for you Id do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So Id do it all over again for you

I missed the first train
Stood out in the rain all day little did I know
When I caught the next train there you were to sweep me away
Guess thats what I waited for

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out 
Removed all my doubts so believe

That for you Id do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So Id do it all over again 

Whoever thought a day gone so wrong 
Would turn out so lovely
Im so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong 
I wouldnt change a thing

Id do it Id do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through lead me to you
So Id do it all over again
x

Whoever thought a day gone so wrong 
Would turn out so lovely
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong 
Would turn out so lovely
Oooohhhh ooohhhh

I used to go out of my mind tryna redefine the real meaning of love
I lost my dignity forgot about me I was so lost in us
I had to take on cause you had me stuck in the middle of nowhere
And my faith it would shake I know youre trying your best to take me

Chorus 
Dream taker wont you leave me alone
Been standing in the way for far too long
Dream maker now its taking your place
Im no longer asleep my heart is finally awake
So goodbye good day farewell its okay
Dream taker wont you leave me alone
Cant wait til youre gone havent dreamt in so long

You used to be the man of my dreams only now it seems you were just a nightmare
But this little light of mine told me open my eyes theres more than darkness out there

And my faith is in place
In the night I no longer see your face

Chorus

Voices in my head

Once again youre home alone
Tears running from your eyes
And Im on the outside
Knowing that 
Youre all I want
But I cant do anything
Im so helpless baby

Everyday same old things
So youre still feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it aint her fault

She knows better but
She cant help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that cant feel its broken
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows

Youve been livin this way so long
You dont know the difference
And its killing me
Cause you can have so much more
Im the one your looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still cant see

Everyday same old things
So youre still feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it aint her fault

She knows better but
She cant help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that cant feel its broken
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows

All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
Shes still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I cant pretend
Wish we were more than friends

She knows better but
She cant help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that cant feel its broken
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows

Standing at this liquor store whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets cheap beer thats why you can catch me here
Tryin to scratch my way to the top

Cause my jobs got me going nowhere
So I aint got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I dont care
This is me and my liquor store blues

One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
Ill be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow

Tryin to leave with more than what I got
Cause cent just aint gonna pay the rent

Ooh
Staring from my room I see them
Holding hands wish I could be them
Lovers doing what we used to do
But Im stuck here alone
Thats the way its been here lately
Youre too busy now to save me
Feels like you forget Im waiting for you

Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you I love you
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me

How do I always end up being the girl at the window
Window window
I tell myself Im not gonna wait for you whenever you go
You go you go
You give me your word and I always take it
You say youll be home but you never make it
So why do I 
Always end up that girl at the window the window
The girl at the window

I know youre working thats why youre leaving
I will never argue your reasons
If this means that you believe in them
Oh time goes on and were growing apart
Broken promises break my heart
Please dont give me a reason to say goodbye
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you I love you
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me

How do I always end up being the girl at the window
Window window
I tell myself Im not gonna wait for you whenever you go
You go you go
You give me your word and I always take it
You say youll be home but you never make it
So why do I 
Always end up that girl at the window the window
The girl at the window

How can I be what youre saying
When you keep turning all the pages
Am I supposed to believe your words are true
Dont take advantage of me cause you know I wont leave you
I make sure you know I always wanna see you
Whoa wont you do it for me too

Oh how do I always end up being the girl at the window
Window window
I tell myself Im not gonna wait for you whenever you go
You go you go
You give me your word and I always take it
You say youll be home but you never make it
So why do I 
Always end up that girl at the window the window
The girl at the window
Damn

Its getting hard to breathe
Im trying to make her see
That she dont really know
That I
Im trying to find a way
And tell her every day 
That she just goes along
So I
I dont wanna be
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Say Good Luck for me
Im standing shaking ground
And Ive been thinking that Im gonna lose it

Chorus 
Cause Im losing my head
Im losing my mind
Im losing control of myself this time
Shes got me losing my head 
Im losing my mind
Im losing my way
But I think she feels Im already lost
Im already lost

Damn

I wish that I could see
But its making you
Feel that you should be insane
My love is like gunshot
All it takes is one shot for me to blow it 
All away
I dont wanna feel 
Like Im just wasting time
Its gonna be with you and no one else
Until you notice me
I need to know right now
Cause Ive been think it that Im gonna lose it

Chorus 
Cause Im losing my head
Im losing my mind
Im losing control of myself this time
Shes got me losing my head 
Im losing my mind
Im losing my way
But I think she feels Im already lost

May be its just too hard
But girl you make me nervous
By now you should have noticed me
And what will it take it
To a heavenly
Cause your drawing chains 
Youre driving me insane

Chorus 
Cause Im losing my head
Im losing my mind
Im losing control of myself this time
Shes got me losing my head 
Im losing my mind
Im losing my way
But I think she feels Im already lost
Ohhh 
Ohhh 

Its not a question of love 
Cause our love has never changed 
But all the little things keep piling up 
And life keeps getting in the way 

Dont make it harder than it is 
We both knew itd come to this 
Better now than in a year 
More night of tears and we both hate each other 
The fuse is already lit so how about a final kiss 
Just let it go 

And stop the madness before it explodes 
Before its out of our control 
Lets stop the madness before it explodes 
We gotta let it go 
Before it all explodes 

Some things we wont understand 
And were both so tired of being misunderstood 
So lets just turn around and walk away 
And hold on to what was good 

Dont make it harder than it is 
We both knew itd come to this 
Better now than in a year 
More nights of tears and we both hate each other 
The fuse is already lit so how about a final kiss 
Just let it go 

And stop the madness before it explodes 
Before its out of our control 
Lets stop the madness before it explodes 
We gotta let it go 
Before it all explodes 

There aint nothing that can save us 
But youre close to the edge 
And whats the use of going on 
If were lying to each other 
Every word that is said 
Its too late for us now 
Cause we can never count down 
Its getting close 
Its gonna blow 

Stop the madness before it explodes 
Before is out of our control 
Lets stop the madness before it explodes 
We gotta let it go 
Before it all explodes 

Gotta stop the madness ohhh

Gave you all of me without question

And just like every other man youre all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste its giving me

Chorus
Im a killer on the run
You broke my heart and 
Now youre staring down my gun
Click clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl

Wipe those tears from your eyes its too late
With that rag in your mouth cant tell what you say
Slide to the train tracks begging me for mercy
This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me

I warned you I told you
It would end this way
You kept on playing all those childish games
And just like every other man youre all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste its giving me

Chorus

Karmas a bitch now shut up and take it

Come back to you

I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Stop believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh I still dream of simple life
Boy meets girl makes her his wife
But love dont exist when you live like this
That much I know yes I know

All these roads would still be wrong
But I still drive them all night long all night long

All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah you young wild girls
Youll be the death of me 
The death of me
All you young wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah you young wild girls
Ill always come back to you 
Come back to you
You you you
You you you
Yeah you you you
You you you

All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah you young wild girls
Youll be the death of me 
The death of me
All you young wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah you young wild girls
Ill always come back to you 
Come back to you
You used to tell me that you love me
And thats what you would say
You used to buy me flowers
Even not on valentines day
You would surprise me with a dinner
Even though you just ate
But what happened
Baby what happened

Were been going through some changes
Through some changes
Like we in different places
Different places
And now you think that you
Can just do what you do
Without any consequences
Consequences

Its not what you say
But what you dont say
Its not what you do
But what you dont do
Its not where we go
But where we dont go

Its like I dont even know you anymore
Youre just a stranger a stranger
And I dont recognize you anymore
Youre just a stranger a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before

You used to look me in my eyes
But now you just look away
If I pull some extra time
You say you just cant stay
Well if you leave me at home alone
For just one more night
I promise its gonna be the last time

Were been going through some changes
Through some changes
Like we in different places
Different places
And now you think that you
Can just do what you do
Without any consequences
Consequences

Its not what you say
But what you dont say
Its not what you do
But what you dont do
Its not where we go
But where we dont go

Its like I dont even know you anymore
Youre just a stranger a stranger
And I dont recognize you no more
Youre just a stranger a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before

What you want me to do
Im not gonna chase after you 
Tell me how can I get 
Back the man I once met

Its not what you say
But what you dont say
You dont say
Its not what you do
But what you dont do
You dont do
Its not where we go
But where we dont go
We dont go
Its like I dont even know you anymore
I dont know you no more
Youre just a stranger a stranger
And I dont recognize you no more
Dont know you no more
Youre just a stranger Dont know you no more
A stranger Dont know you no more more no no no
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it dont sound the same
When our friends talk about you all that it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
And it all just sounds like uh uh uh

Hmmm too young too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing but shes dancing with another man

My pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never never get to clean up the mess I made
And it hunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like uh uh uh uh

Too young too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
Should have gave all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing but shes dancing with another man

Although it hurts Ill be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh I know Im probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers I hope he holds your hands
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man
Everyday I wake up next to a angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldnt work but what did they know
Cause years passed and were still here today
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

As I stand here before my woman
I cant fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I mustve done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life

Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies by when youre in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait cause I finally found the one
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

As I stand here before my woman
I cant fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I mustve done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life
Im tripping out
Im tripping out
We met in a crowded place
Expression on her face
The look in her eyes says she wanted me
So I played it cool
But inside I knew
If I made my move
Then hand it for shes seconds away

Me and you touching dancing the night away
Im not the one Im not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind

Tripping out

Time was standing still
A destiny fulfilled
Just watching her body movement all night long
Then she took my hand instantly we danced
She knew by my angst that I wanted more

Me and you touching dancing the night away
Im not the one Im not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind

Truth of the matter is Im complicated 
Youre as straight as they come 
You go bout your day baby 
While I hide from the sun 

Chorus
Its better if you dont understand 
Cause you wont know what its like 
Til you try 

You know Ive been waiting on the other side 
And you all you gotta do is cross the line 
I could wait a whole life time but you just gotta decide 
You know I Ive been waiting on the other 
Waiting on the other side 

We would live forever 
Who could ask for more 
You could die if you wanted 
But baby what for 

Chorus x
Its better if you dont understand 
And you wont know what its like 
Til you try 

If they say lifes a dream 
Call this insomnia 
Cause this aint Wonderland 
It damn sure aint Narnia 
And once you cross the line 
You cant change your mind 
Yeah Im a monster 
But Im no Frankenstein 

And quite frankly 
Ive been feeling insane in between my eyes 
I really cant explain what I feel inside 
If you knew what I was 
Youd run and hide 

Many have tried to go into the night 
cross over the line and come back alive 
But thats the price we pay 
When we living on the other side 

Chorus

Its better if you dont understand x



Feel your heart beating fast
Hold me close make it last
We knew this day would come
So take a breath leave me and
Was so scared of you leaving
Wish we could both just run
Wish we could run it off
But we cant stop time 

Seems the clock is running too fast
And now Im feeling lost
And I cant read your mind
But you dont have to ask

You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
Youre the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I cant live without my heart
I hope you come home soon soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait 
Wait wait wait for you oh

Our phone calls will have to do
Write you letters just to prove
Youre the only thing on my mind
I know its hard but well get through
Just hold on I promise you
Soon youll be here by my side
But we cant stop time

Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now Im feeling lost
And I cant read your mind
But you dont have to ask

You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
Youre the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I cant live without my heart
I hope you come home soon soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh
When I was just a little boy
Barely strong enough to stand
I could always count on him
He taught me everything I know
And till this day it shows
He was more than just a friend

There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

Chorus
How would I be where I am
If my father didnt tell me
To never say I cant
Hed carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you cant
Oh never say you cant

So when lifes rain begins to fall
And youre out there on your own
And you cant see a thing
Oh no no no
Just find a voice that understands
For me it was my old man
Taught me to say the words I can

There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

Chorus
How would I be where I am
If my father didnt tell me
To never say I cant
Hed carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you cant
Oh never say you cant

Everything he taught me would stay with me forever
No I wont forget a thing
Oh because of dad I now know myself better
And I hope I can do for him what he did for me

Chorus
How would I be where I am
If my father didnt tell me
To never say I cant
Hed carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you cant
Oh never say you cant
Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like
I hope it feels like tonight 
Hope it feels like tonight 
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like 
I hope it feels like tonight 
Hope it feels like tonight 

With that look upon your face 
Baby I know what youre thinking about oh 
Youve got your lips along my body 
And Im not gonna stop you know oh 
You wanna take me to a place 
Where I cant control my face somehow oh 
You know Im down 
So boy you gonna let me down oh 
Oh you got your love dripping all over me 
The only thing I can say is uhuu 
I dont wanna wait 
Just my days 
Its yours come get it get it 

Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like
I hope it feels like tonight 
Hope it feels like tonight 
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like 
I hope it feels like tonight 
Hope it feels like tonight 

The way youre getting in 
I can tell youre not playing no more 
Im an angel in disguise 
With the devil as surprise for you oh 
There is no breaking no stopping 
Just go go go 
We sing and dont take it personal 
It feels like Heaven when 
Got me screaming on the morning oh oh 
Youve got your love tripping all over me 
The only thing I can say is uhuuu 
I dont wanna wait 
Just open up my 
Its yours come get it get it uhuuu

Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like
I hope it feels like tonight 
Hope it feels like tonight 
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like 
I hope it feels like tonight 
Hope it feels like tonight

Here I am again doing things I said that I wouldnt do

Waiting all day but now you wanna call me
Why do you do this to me all the time

After all the things you put me through 
Still I come right back
But now I know the truth I can finally see
You only want me when youre lonely 
If I say Im gonna leave 
Thats the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I wont make it
Another late night call I wont take it
Cos now I finally see 
You only want me when youre lonely
Only when youre lonely lonely
Only when youre lonely
Only when youre lonely lonely
Only when youre lonely

Had me fooled from the start 
And I quickly gave my heart
Cause I love you love you love you
But this is what happens 
When youre a lonely girl with no one to touch you
Now Im stronger dont need you any longer
So get off your knees your words dont mean anything

After all the things you put me through 
Still I come right back
But now I know the truth I can finally see
You only want me when youre lonely 
If I say Im gonna leave 
Thats the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I wont make it
Another late night call I wont take it
Cos now I finally see 
You only want me when youre lonely

Oh nothings ever changing decisions you cant make it
You just think of yourself and never me at all
If youre with your friend you just leave me alone
But I wont allow it anymore so its time for me to move on

Cos I can finally see 
You only want me when youre lonely 
If I say Im gonna leave 
Thats the only time you want me 
Next time you need me there I wont make it
Another late night call I wont take it
Cos now I finally see 
You only want me when youre lonely
Only when youre lonely lonely
Only when youre lonely
Only when youre lonely lonely
Only when youre lonely

You only want me when youre lonely 
If I say Im gonna leave 
Thats the only time you want me 
Next time you need me there I wont make it
Another late night call I wont take it

You only want me when youre lonely
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
Its unfair shes out there

Somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn
Shes somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn

Little miss perfect sitting at the train stop
Red nike high tops listening to hiphop
While we were waiting started conversating
Before I got her name along came a train

uuuuuuuh next stop Brooklyn
uuuuuuuh now Im lookin

She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
Its unfair shes out there
Somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn
Shes somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn

On the street kickin rocks circling the same block
Green farm Flatbush checking every corner shop
Tappin peoples shoulders askin if they know her
Everydays the same back to the train

uuuuuuuh next stop Brooklyn
uuuuuuuh Im still lookin

She was covered in leather and gold
 years old
I lost her in the cold
Its unfair shes out there
Somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn
Shes somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn

Ohohohoh
I wonder if well ever meet again
Ohohohoh
I wonder if well ever meet again
Yeah I wonder if well meet again
I hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn



Today I dont feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Dont feel like picking up my phone 
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear 
Im not doing anything

Im gonna kick my feet up 
And stare at the fan
Turn the TV on throw my hand in my pants
Nobodys gon tell me I cant

Ill be lounging on the couch 
Just chillin in my Snuggie
Click to MTV so they can 
Teach me how to dougie
Cus in my castle Im the freakin man

Oh yes I said it I said it

Chorus
Today I dont feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Dont feel like picking up my phone 
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear

Nothing at all nothing at all

Tomorrow Ill wake up do some PX
Find a really nice girl 
Have some really nice sex
And shes gonna sream out
This is great 
Oh my god this is great

Yeah I might mess around 
And get my college degree
I bet my old man would be so proud of me
But sorry pops youll just have to wait

Oh yes I said it I said it
I said it cause I can

Chorus
Today I dont feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Dont feel like picking up my phone 
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear

No I aint gonna comb my hair
Cus I aint going anywhere
No No No No No No No No No

Ill just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

Chorus
Oh today I dont feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Dont feel like picking up my phone 
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear 
Im not doing anything

Nothing at all 
Nothing at all

Verse 
 If you ever leave me baby
 Leave some morphine at my door
 Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
 To realize what we used to have
 We dont have it anymore
 Theres no religion that could save me
 No matter how long my knees are on the floor oh
 So keep in mind all the sacrifices Im making
 Will keep you by my side
 Will keep you from walking out the door

Chorus
 Cause therell be no sunlight
 If I lose you baby
 Therell be no clear skies
 If I lose you baby
 Just like the clouds 
 My eyes will do the same if you walk away
 Everyday it will rain
 Rain rain

Verse 
 Ill never be your mothers favorite
 Your daddy cant even look me in the eyes
 Oooh if I was in their shoes Id be doing the same thing
 Saying there goes my little girl
 Walking with that troublesome guy
 But theyre just afraid of something they cant understand
 Oooh well little darling 
Watch me change their minds
 Yea for you Ill try Ill try Ill try
 Ill pick up these broken pieces till Im bleeding
 If thatll make you mine

Chorus
 Cause therell be no sunlight
 If I lose you baby
 Therell be no clear skies
 If I lose you baby
 Just like the clouds 
 My eyes will do the same if you walk away
 Everyday it will rain
 Rain rain

Bridge
 Oooh dont you say goodbye 
 Dont just say goodbye
 Ill pick up these broken pieces till Im bleeding
 If thatll make it right

Chorus
 Cause therell be no sunlight
 If I lose you baby
 Therell be no clear skies
 If I lose you baby
 Just like the clouds 
 My eyes will do the same if you walk away
 Everyday it will rain
 Rain rain

Im trapped in without her somewhere far away
I keep thinking about her but I know I cant stay
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere
She doesnt leave me alone
I cant escape her or erase her
When I know shes not coming home

I cant understand where I went wrong
I cant understand where her love has gone
I dont know where I belong
My world is over
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on
her world goes on
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on
my world is gone

Am I crazy or just human
Is this what heartbreak is
What should I be doing
It feels like I got seconds to live
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere
She doesnt leave me alone
I cant escape her or erase her
When I know shes not coming home

I cant understand where I went wrong
I cant understand where her love has gone
I dont know where I belong
My world is over
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on
her world goes on
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on
my world is gone

My world is over while her world goes on
i dont know where I belong
My world is over
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on
her world goes on
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on
my world is gone
